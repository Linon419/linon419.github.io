<p>B:	Sure, Johnny, how much do you need? Five bucks?</p>
<p>A:	Come on, Dad, I need thirty thousand. I wanna get into the market. You know, I’m tired of hearing all this news about the economic downturn, the inevitable recession, people stuffing their money in their mattresses. I look at this as an opportunity. This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.</p>
<p>B:	I don’t know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don’t know if you’re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There’s just too much instability. I wouldn’t feel comfortable investing in this climate.</p>
<p>A:	But look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I’m not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example; they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods rePresents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.</p>
<p>B:	Come on, son, you’re looking at this too naively, the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by</p>
<p>almost a whole percentage point.</p>
<p>A:	Fine, then! If that’s the way you feel, so be it. But you’re losing out on a great opportunity here. I’m going to go hit up Mum for the cash.</p>

<p>A:	I called this meeting today in order to discuss our manufacturing plan. As I’m sure you’re all aware, with the credit crunch, and the global financial crisis, we’re obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods. We don’t want to have to be looking at redundancies. So, we’ve outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy.</p>
<p>B:	We have two basic points that we want to focus on. First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.</p>
<p>C:	Why would want to do that? I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.</p>
<p>B:	Well, we want to reduce production and delivery lead timesfor better overall efficiency.</p>
<p>A:	Right, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes. Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.</p>
<p>C:	I see&amp; That makes sense.</p>
<p>B:	The second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program. We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore, they must be eliminated. A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers the personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.</p>
<p>C:	I’m with you on this one. It’s essential that we reduce these errors; we’ve got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.</p>
<p>A:	Exactly. Well, let’s look at how we’re going to put this plan into action. First&hellip;(fade out)</p>

<p>A:	So what would your role in the company?</p>
<p>B:	Well, the position is for an account manager. That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team.</p>
<p>A:	Sounds good, and so, why do you want to work with them?</p>
<p>B:	Well, as I said they’re the industry leaders, they have a really great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees, and it seems like they have strong corporate governance.</p>
<p>They’re all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential. I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me. Oh, and they offer six weeks’ vacation, stock options and bonuses&hellip; I’m totally going to cash in on that.</p>

<p>A:	Thanks for coming in today, did you have any trouble finding us? Please take a seat.</p>
<p>B:	Thank you.</p>
<p>A:	So, let’s get started; tell me a bit about your educational background.</p>
<p>B:	Sure! Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration, with a specialization in Information Management, and I minored in psychology. I chose</p>
<p>this course of study for two reasons: I wanted to gain some practical, marketable skills, which the information management track provided, and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success, hence the minor in psychology.</p>
<p>A:	Interesting. And, your postgraduate studies?</p>
<p>B:	Well, I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a master’s in that area. I also strive to keep my professional skills current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service.</p>
<p>A:	Very good. Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience. I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care, and process management. I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>A:	Interesting&hellip;</p>
<p>B:	Yes, in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company. With the different initiatives that we implemented, we lowered our churn rate to about five percent, which had a direct impact on revenue.</p>

<p>C:	I have something to confess&hellip; I’m sorry Veronica,</p>
<p>I lied.</p>
<p>B:	Wait&hellip; what? What do do you mean?</p>
<p>C:	I lied. You aren’t even pregnant; there’s no bun in the oven. I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn’t help myself. Veronica I love you!</p>
<p>B:	What are you talking about!!! Who are you?</p>
<p>C:	It’s me! Daniel, don’t you remember me? From high school. I sat behind you every day in class! I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad!</p>
<p>B:	You are insane! We never even spoke! Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend?</p>
<p>C:	Because Veronica&hellip; It’s not fair! I love you; I have since the first day we met! Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything!

<p>B:	I hope they’re not too hard!</p>
<p>A:	Well, why should we hire you?</p>
<p>B:	I think that I would be a perfect fit in this company. I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen, and outstanding soft skills; you know, I excel at building strong, long-term customer relationships. For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team solved about seventy percent of our customers’ problems. I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products, so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers’ issues. Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.</p>
<p>A:	Impressive! So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?</p>
<p>B:	To be honest, I struggle with organization and time management. Punctuality has never been a strength of mine. I find it hard to organize my time</p>
<p>efficiently. I have actually addressed this weakness recently, by attending a workshop on efficient time management. It helped me a lot, by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently, so I think I’m getting better now.</p>
<p>A:	Great&hellip; Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview. We are short-listing our candidates this week, and next week we will inform our short listed candidates of the day and time for a second interview with our CEO.</p>
<p>B:	Great, thanks a lot! I hope to hear from you! Good bye.</p>

<h2 id="elementary--the-weekend--international-workers-day-c0078">Elementary ‐ The Weekend ‐ International Workers Day (C0078)</h2>
<p>A:	Alright everyone settle down. Let’s get started. As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system. It is not enough to simply memorize our laws, it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed. This brings me to our topic for today. Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first?</p>
<p>B:	Cinco de mayo?</p>
<p>A:	No, that’s May fifth in Spanish, James, no wonder you are failing my Spanish class. No, May first is</p>
<p>International Workers’ Day.</p>
<p>B:	Do we get a day off from school then?</p>
<p>A:	No! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.</p>
<p>B:	Aww, man!</p>
<p>A:	In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of</p>
<p>many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.</p>
<p>B:	Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?</p>
<p>A:	Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price. On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.</p>
<p>B:	And then what happened?</p>
<p>A:	Well, as we say, the rest is history&hellip;</p>

<p>A:	What’s up? You don’t look too good.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah, my head hurts, that’s all. I’ve been in physics class all day. It’s killer!</p>
<p>A:	I liked physics. It’s all math, really; arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah, yeah, but today’s lesson was all about the creation of the universe.</p>
<p>A:	A physics class about the creation of the universe?</p>
<p>That’s  some  pretty  unscientific  language  there.</p>
<p>Sounds more religious to me.</p>
<p>B:	It’s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That’s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.</p>
<p>A:	Turtles? Whatever&hellip; Look, all that’s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that’s what the math says.</p>
<p>B:	Math, shmath. What’s the evidence?</p>
<p>A:	There is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He’s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang&hellip; DUH!</p>
<p>B:	Anyway, it’s just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where’s the scientific rigor in that?</p>
<p>A:	Dude, don’t equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, didn’t you?</p>
<p>B:	Agh! You’re making my head hurt again! Quit with the questions!</p>

<h2 id="elementary--global-view--movie-review-c-0099">Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Movie Review (C 0099)</h2>
<p>A:	Welcome back movie lovers to another ” Premier Movie Review”. My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson.</p>
<p>B:	Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about</p>
<p>the movie ” Lion King”. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?</p>
<p>A:	Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man’s eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it’s a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.</p>
<p>B:	I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.</p>
<p>A:	Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It’s a G-rated movie! It’s for the kids! It’s not a thriller!</p>
<p>B:	Well, that’s just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasa dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it’s his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It’s just too cliché.</p>
<p>A:	How can it be cliché? It’s a fable! It’s telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.</p>
<p>B:	You have always been so soft, Dave!</p>
<p>A:	Open your heart Dick. Don’t shut us out.</p>
<p>B:	Anyway&hellip; That’s all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk about &quot;How to lose a guy in 10 days&quot; I’m sure you’ll love that one Dave!</p>

<p>B:	From China.</p>
<p>A:	Really? You don’t look very Chinese to me, if you don’t mind me saying so.</p>
<p>B:	It’s fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.</p>
<p>A:	Wow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, how old are you?</p>
<p>B:	Don’t you know it’s rude to ask a lady her age?</p>

<h2 id="elementary--global-view--global-warming-c0102">Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Global Warming (C0102)</h2>
<p>A:	And therefore, global warming is the greatest deception of the early 21st century. Questions?</p>
<p>B:	Uh&amp; yeah. In the lecture you said theres more evidence in the scientific record supporting global cooling?</p>
<p>A:	Well, yes, essentially, the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles. Warming and cooling are cooperating processes in the planetary eco-system.</p>
<p>B:	If thats true and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the polar ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?</p>
<p>A:	But are global temperatures rising? If you look at the data from nineteen seventy-five youll&amp;</p>
<p>B:	Youll be misled. If you were serious, you would look at the record starting in the 1880s. Then you would see how dramatically the earths temperature has changed.</p>
<p>A:	Young lady, I beg to differ. Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there is evidence for</p>
<p>both sides, and I’m putting forth the argument that there’s greater evidence in support of the global cooling hypothesis. Look, it’s an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared into believing theres some kind of climate crisis; this scaremongering is done, quite simply, for political reasons.</p>
<p>B:	But even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, isnt the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?</p>
<p>A:	Not if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species and investing in renewable energy. At the very least, you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence on foreign oil. Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.</p>
<p>A:	Why, Ive never been so disrespected in all of my days. I’m a professor, a scientist and researcher of high regard.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah, and a duplicitous one at that. Everyone knows youre in the pocket of the oil lobby. Why should we trust your so-called findings more than tobacco institute studies which say smoking doesnt harm health? Youre full of it.</p>

<p>B:	Yes, yes I did. Please come in! I’m so glad you came! This old house is falling apart! Come on into the bathroom. See, here, there’s water leaking everywhere!</p>
<p>A:	I see. Let me have a look. It seems that your toilet is clogged, and that’s why it won’t flush. Let me just get my plunger. No, that’s not working either. I suspect that there’s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that’s causing a blockage. That’s what’s making your toilet overflow.</p>
<p>B:	Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter. She is always flushing things down the toilet. You know how kids are.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. That could be causing water to not drain completely; that might lead to more problems in the future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn’t shutting off properly. I could have it all finished by today if it’s urgent.</p>
<p>B:	That would be great! Is it expensive?</p>

<p>B:	I know, I’m really sorry that I missed the deadline. But really, it wasn’t my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn’t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analyis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the CRM stable, then I wouldn’t have missed my deadline.</p>

<p>B:	No, I’m not trying to pass the buck here; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn’t gone down. And you know, with everything I’ve got going on now, I can’t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems. I’ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day&hellip;</p>
<p>A:	I’m not going to accept this excuse. You’re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying</p>
<p>to rationalize the fact that you’ve missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phoney excuses. If you’re in over your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by nine am!</p>

Three days from now, after a half-century of service of our country, I shall lay down the responsibilities of office as, in a traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the Presidency is vested in my successor. This evening I come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen.</p>
<p>A:	Like every other citizen, I wish the new President, and all who will labor with him, Godspeed. I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.</p>
<p>A:	Our people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our great nation. My own relations with Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point. I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationship with Congress during the war and immediate post-war period. Finally, we have progressed to the mutually interdependent relationship we’ve had during these</p>

Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world. We are understandably proud of this preeminence, yet we realize that America’s leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.</p>

<p>nations, may have their great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings; that those who have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibilities; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; that the scourges of poverty, disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth, and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.</p>

<p>tickets for a trip around the world.</p>
<p>B:	If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure!</p>
<p>A:	My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that!</p>
<p>B:	Alright this is a good one. What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married?</p>
<p>A:	If I told her that, she would faint and have me committed!</p>

<p>A:	Howdy! Nice car! What seems to be the problem?</p>
<p>B:	I don’t know! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me. Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here. What do you think it is?</p>
<p>A:	Not sure yet. How about you pop the hood and we can take a look. Hmmm, it doesn’t look good.</p>
<p>B:	What do you mean? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month. It’s brand new!</p>
<p>A:	Well missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator. You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission. You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died.</p>
<p>B:	Ugh&hellip; So how long is this going to take? An hour?</p>
<p>A:	I’m afraid a bit more than that. We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again. You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.</p>
<p>B:	What! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping? This is not happening!</p>

<p>B:	I know, I know. OK, so I have to separate the colors from the whites and put them in this strange looking contraption so called washing machine.</p>
<p>A:	Right. You have to turn it on and program it depending on what type of clothes you are washing. For example for delicates, you should set a shorter washing cycle. Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.</p>
<p>B:	So complicated! Ok, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out?</p>
<p>A:	Since this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a</p>
<p>little bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.</p>
<p>B:	Cool. Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and its all set right?</p>
<p>A:	No! Since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes.</p>
<p>B:	You know what? I’ll just have everything dry cleaned.</p>

<p>B:	I’m looking to upgrade to a newer, bigger television set.</p>
<p>C:	You’ve come to the right place! What size are you looking for?</p>
<p>A:	Just a normal sized TV for our living room.</p>
<p>C:	I see. Well this set here is on sale. It’s a forty six inch HDTV screen and has all the works. Three HDMI connectors, USB, VGA and S - Video ports. It even has a DVI port so you can hook up your PC or laptop! This is without a doubt the complete home theater experience!</p>
<p>B:	This is exactly what I need! Can you imagine watching movies or playing video games on this thing?</p>
<p>A:	Honey, I think it’s a bit too big. I don’t even think it will fit in our living room.</p>
<p>C:	Not to worry, we will deliver and install it in your home. It comes with a wall mount so you can just hang it on the wall like a picture!</p>
<p>B:	This is great! How much will this set me back?</p>

<p>A:	I just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It’s so hard to talk to him at times.</p>
<p>B:	Maybe it’s just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what’s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off.</p>
<p>B:	Men are like that you know. They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.</p>
<p>A:	I guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn’t always this grouchy you know&hellip;</p>
<p>B:	Talk to him, try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn’t work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!</p>

<h2 id="elementary--global-view--gambling-c0136-">Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Gambling (C0136 )</h2>
<p>A:	Did you hear? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business!</p>
<p>B:	Are you serious? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me.</p>
<p>A:	What are you talking about? How does it exploit people?</p>
<p>B:	Well, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.</p>
<p>A:	Geez! Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn’t such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, and I didn’t become addicted or anything like that.</p>
<p>B:	You cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling. Now excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize!</p>

<p>B:	I have no idea what kbps means. I just want to be able to get online, play games and chat with my friends. Oh, and watch movies online as well.</p>
<p>A:	Well, this connection might be a bit too slow for your needs. I suggest you get the premium package for fifty dollars a month which includes a connection speed of two megabytes.

<p>Agent: I know why we have reservations.</p>
<p>Man: I don’t think you do. If you did, I’d have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don’t know how to hold the reservation and that’s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.</p>

<p>Bobby: Cool!</p>
<p>Daddy: Ok, each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I’ll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, you set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally. Bobby: What about all these other pieces?</p>
<p>Daddy: See this one that looks like a tower? It’s called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, it’s a very important piece so it’s best to not let your opponent capture it.</p>
<p>Bobby: And these two? They are husband and wife?</p>
<p>Daddy: That’s right! That’s the queen and that’s the king. If the other player captures your king, he will say ”Check Mate” and the game is over! Doesn’t this sound fun?</p>

<p>ProfeTsshoar:t’s all for today’s class. We will continue our lecture on crime and punishment tomorrow.</p>
<p>A:	Do you think we should be tougher on crime?</p>
<p>B:	Well, it depends on what you mean.</p>
<p>A:	For example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences for lesser offences and lock up juvenile offenders.</p>
<p>B:	Those really sound like Draconian measures. Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you’ve already put innocent people to death?</p>
<p>A:	You’d only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you’d convicted the right person.</p>
<p>B:	But, there’ve been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years. The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable. In some cases, it’d been fabricated by the</p>
<p>police.</p>
<p>A:	Well, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there’s a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.</p>
<p>B:	I doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low. The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they’re going to be caught. It doesn’t make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.</p>
<p>A:	But if you detect more crimes, you’ll still need prisons. In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they’d learn that they couldn’t get away with it. Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.</p>
<p>B:	Yes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals. To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.</p>
<p>A:	Well, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment. I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.</p>
<p>B:	You sound like a dictator!</p>
<p>A:	Well if it works, why not?</p>

<p>B:	What’s wrong?</p>
<p>A:	I think you have chicken pox! You are contagious!</p>
<p>Get away! Don’t breathe on me!</p>
<p>B:	Maybe it’s just a rash or an allergy! We can’t be sure until I see a doctor.</p>
<p>A:	Well in the meantime you are a biohazard! I didn’t get it when I was a kid and I’ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult!</p>

<h2 id="elementary--global-view--animal-rights-c-0146">Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Animal Rights (C 0146)</h2>
<p>A:	You should have seen the T.V. show that was on last night, the topic it covered was really interesting; animal rights.</p>
<p>B:	Do you really believe in that? If they are going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.</p>
<p>A:	Yes, but we cant deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.</p>
<p>B:	I understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights. If so much attention weren’t devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.</p>
<p>A:	You can’t compare apples and oranges; I believe that both topics are important and that we can’t ignore them, the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.</p>
<p>B:	Well, you are right on that point. This is the reason that I don’t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.</p>
<p>B:	At least youre doing your part. My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.</p>

<p>B:	I’m thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you’re always so negative.</p>

<p>B:	I’m going to Anthropology class and now with the year anniversary of Darwin, it’s the only thing we study. Frankly, I’m sick and tired and tired of hearing about this guy.</p>
<p>A:	What? Why? How can you not like Darwin? I mean the man changed the entire perception of how things came to and his theory is backed by pretty solid evidence!</p>
<p>B:	I don’t like him. His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes. It lacks the solid evidence of which you speak of.</p>
<p>A:	That statement puts you at odds with half of the academy. Not to mention your professors! Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of species and the mechanism of natural selection constitutes a grand step toward a coherent understanding of the world and evolutionist</p>
<p>ideas.</p>
<p>B:	I’m not minimizing his grand contributions, it’s just that his theory reminds of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.</p>
<p>A:	What are you talking about?</p>
<p>B:	The question is, which was first? The chicken or the egg? I feel the same regarding his theory. How does the first cell of life come to be?</p>

<p>Sarah: Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I’d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.</p>
<p>Tom: I see what you mean, but I ’m still bummed out.</p>
<p>Sarah: Ok how does this sound: let’s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there!</p>
<p>Tom: You know, I could really go for that. You don’t mind being my wingman for tonight?</p>
<p>Sarah: Not at all! It be fun! It will be like a boys night out&hellip; well kinda&hellip;</p>
<p>Tom: Great! I must warn you though, whatever happens, don’t let me go on a drinking binge. Trust me, it’s not a pretty picture!</p>

<p>(fade out - fade in new scene) I was living with my father at the time, when he received a phone call.</p>
<p>B:	Hmm&hellip; I know! I’ll tell you a scary story! It happened to me and my dad when I was a teenager&hellip;I was living with my father at the time, when he received a phone call. I was living with my father at the time, when he received a phone call.</p>
<p>FatheHr:ello? Yes this is him. I see, I’m sorry to hear that. Ok no problem. I’ll be there shortly. Pack some clothes Tony, my great aunt is very ill and no one in the family wants to take care of her. We are going to stay at her house for a few days.</p>
<p>Kid: Aunt? What aunt? I never knew you had a great aunt!</p>
<p>FatheWr:ell, the family doesn’t talk about her or get near her, for that matter.</p>
<p>Kid: Why is that?</p>
<p>FatheCr:ome on, we have to go.</p>
<p>B:	So we arrived at this old house on the outskirts of</p>
<p>our town. There was almost no one around and the house had an eerie look to it. Once inside the house, we walked to her room and I was surprised to find my dad’s great aunt in a wheelchair, yelling at someone, but we were alone in the room. FatheHr:i, aunt Ursula! This is my son Tony.</p>
<p>UrsulWa:hy have you come? Why are you here? Don’t you know it isn’t safe? My time is near, he is coming for me.</p>
<p>Kid: Who is coming for you?</p>
<p>UrsulTah: e prince of darkness! The lord of the underworld, the tempter, the old serpent. FatheCr:ome on, aunt Ursula let’s lay you down. You need to get some rest. Tony, help me lay her down.</p>
<p>B:	That night, we slept in one of the 12 rooms of that big old mansion. The trees outside seemed to come alive and their shadows formed ghoulish shapes on my bed. All of a sudden, we heard screaming.</p>
<p>UrsulAah: hh! Get off me beast! I won’t let you take me! Ahhh!</p>
<p>Kid: Dad! Dad! Something is attacking aunt Ursula!</p>
<p>UrsulUa:rsula: Take your claws off me! Go back to the underworld you demon! I shall be judged before you can take me!</p>
<p>FatheTrh: e door is jammed! Stand back! Aunt Ursula! Where are you?</p>
<p>Kid: Over here!</p>
<p>B:	And as we approached her, she was lying on the floor, with her hands and feet open like the Vitruvian Man, breathing heavily with bloody marks and scratches on her arms, legs and face. Remember how I mentioned that she was in a wheel chair? My aunt had been paralyzed from the neck down for just over a year. After this incident, strange things would happen in the house and my aunt would yell and scream, according to her, warding off the evil that had come to get her. As the days passed, she became very weak and eventually was unable to talk. My dad had to work during the day, so I was left to care for her. When she lost her voice and laid on her death bed, I would hear her breathe, in and out.</p>
<p>B:	Until finally one day, she breathed in&hellip; and never exhaled. That night, I felt relieved that it was finally over, but it wasn’t.</p>
<p>B:	I was so terrified of what I was hearing, that I didn’t sleep all night. The following morning, I went to the bathroom, expecting to find a mess and everything torn up, but I found everything exactly as it was before. The movers came that same day and</p>
<p>as we were cleaning out her drawers and personal items, we found strange notebooks with names and amounts of money written next to them. We found pictures with people’s faces sewn with black or red string. And you want to know what the strangest thing was? There was a small doll, filled with dead ants, with a strand of hair tied around it’s waist, and on the doll’s face, there was a picture of me with the numbers: ”311009”. You know what date it is today? October 31st, 2009&hellip;.</p>

<p>B:	Exactly! I searched on the web and found a couple of HMO’s with low co pays and good coverage. The deductibles are low, too.</p>

<p>B:	Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K?</p>

<p>B:	That’s interesting and logical I guess. In my country, we also have to contribute to a government run retirement fund, but most people don’t really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that.</p>
<p>A:	That seems a bit unstable don’t you think?</p>
<p>B:	Yeah, but corrupt governments inthe past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.</p>

<p>A:	Dear Mary, I come here today, in this way, because I need to apologize to you. I failed you. Although I did not lie to you in words, I lied to you with faces that did not belong to me. I never meant to ruin the friendship that meant the world to me. You mean the world to me and now I come to you asking for forgiveness. If in your heart you find you can’t, then I will understand and learn from this experience.</p>
<p>A:	You came into my life at a time when I needed you the most. We talked about so many things that I started to realize my heart and my soul could actually</p>
<p>feel something other than hurt. You placed comfort where there was fear, confidence where there was doubt, a shoulder where tears could fall and completeness where there was emptiness. I wanted to hold onto to this so badly that I did whatever it took for you to notice. What I didn’t realize was that</p>
<p>I could lose my entire being, all of who I was and all that I had placed in you.</p>
<p>A:	I wanted to be the one who would be there when you needed to talk. I wanted to be the comfort for your soul when the world was too much to handle. I wanted to be strong for you when everything else seemed impossible. I wanted to love you in only the way you deserved to be loved, never realizing that I was destroying myself and you. Somehow I needed you to be a part of my life. The only problem was that I was willing to jeopardize everything to get that done.</p>
<p>A:	All the things that I told you about how I felt and how you make me feel were true. Nothing else mattered to me except hearing the laughter in your voice when you were happy. You made my days easy to get through and my nights peaceful; you helped me look forward to another day. Even though distance separated us, just being was enough.</p>
<p>A:	I’m sorry for hurting you and if I had to do all over again I would have been 100% with you. Forgive me please,</p>

<p>B:	Hello Sir may I help you?</p>
<p>A:	Yes. I would like some information for requesting a loan.</p>
<p>B:	Very well, here are the general terms of our loan policies. We pride ourselves in having the lowest interest rate in the country for personal loans.</p>
<p>A:	I see. So let me get this straight. If I borrow let’s say, ten thousand dollars, how much will I have to pay each month?</p>
<p>B:	It depends on how long you take to pay it back. If we lend you ten thousand dollars at an annual interest rate of ten percent for forty eight months, you would have to pay each month a portion of the loan which is called the principal and another small portion of the annual interest rate. This of course is considering that you don’t default on a payment!</p>
<p>A:	It sounds good but, there is just one problem. I have a terrible credit score.</p>
<p>B:	That is a very serious problem you see, the bank must assess your personal information, past loans, assets and any other relevant information such as your credit score in order to approve your loan.</p>
<p>A:	You know what? I don’t really need the money.</p>
<p>Thanks anyways!</p>

<p>B:	Whatever, I think I’m gonna get liposuction and a nose job and some breast implants as well.</p>
<p>A:	I think you need to get brain surgery. I honestly don’t think you need cosmetic surgery. You look amazing.</p>
<p>B:	I thought you were my friend and would support me on this! I just want to feel better about myself and feel more attractive.</p>

<p>A:	Welcome Mr and Mrs Carnwell, please take a seat.</p>
<p>B:	Thank you.</p>
<p>A:	So I understand that your family spending has sky rocketed and you want to start budgeting.</p>
<p>C:	Yes that’s correct. Frankly speaking our household income is relatively high and we have never had any money problems, but I think this is the main reason as to why our spending has gone out of control.</p>
<p>B:	We have two kids and with allowances, paying their credit cards, ours and not to mention our mortgage and car payments. With the recent economic downturn, my husband’s business has suffered and now we need some advice as to how we can prepare a family budget.</p>
<p>A:	I see. Well you have come to the right place. First what we need to do, is determine your cash flow. Knowing how much money is coming in will help us allocate spending to different categories such as mortgage, education, groceries, etc.</p>
<p>B:	Yes that makes sense.</p>
<p>A:	Secondly, I need you to bring all of your receipts for the last two to three months. That way, we can determine what your average expenditures are and see which category you are spending money on the most.

<p>B:	Again? You just went last week! You spend more time atthe nail salon than you do here at home! Honestly, why do you need a manicure every week?</p>
<p>A:	Well, first of all, I like to pamper myself, and my nails look great. You should come with me!</p>
<p>B:	Why? I don’t want to have nail polish or anything like that!</p>
<p>A:	They don’t only paint my nails! The manicurist will remove my cuticles, file my nails, and apply at least nails coats of nail polish!</p>

<p>do.</p>

<p>A:	Did you read this? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family.</p>
<p>B:	Why would that be funny?</p>
<p>A:	Well, think about it. We are a society that is always on the go, not because we have to, but because we want to.</p>
<p>B:	Why?</p>
<p>A:	We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.</p>
<p>B:	I don’t agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a new year’s resolution yourself.</p>
<p>A:	What’s the point? We always make a new year’s resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it. It’s pointless.</p>
<p>B:	Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives.</p>
<p>A:	What about you? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.</p>

<p>B:	Put on a sweater! I’m not gonna let you run up my heating bill just because it’s a bit chilly.</p>
<p>A:	Dad! I’m gonna catch a cold!</p>
<p>B:	When I was your age, my parents didn’t have central heating like you do! We had a furnace in the center of the living room and that was it. We used it to cook, heat the house and even dry our clothes! We never caught a cold. You should be grateful!</p>

<p>A:	That’s just it! I don’t know what to get her! Last year I got her a ring that was two sizes too big and a pair of shoes five sizes too small! I suck at getting presents for people.</p>
<p>B:	That’s where you’re making a big mistake! You can’t just guess peoples’ likes or sizes! Especially with clothes or jewelry. On top of that, I think that you should get your mom something that shows how much you love her. At the same time you should</p>
<p>show her that you took the time and effort to look for something that she would really like!</p>
<p>A:	Yeah you’re right. When it comes down to it, I can be pretty tacky.</p>

<p>B:	Have you ever written up a business plan before?</p>
<p>A:	Well, it can’t be that hard! I mean, all you have to do is explain your business, how you are going to do things and that’s it, right?</p>
<p>B:	You couldn’t be more wrong! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less. Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has, history, etc.</p>
<p>A:	Well that seems easy enough.</p>
<p>B:	Wait, there’s more! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services. What they are and how they are different from competitors’? Then comes the hard part, a market analysis. You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has! All this information is</p>
<p>‐	useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage, where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea.</p>
<p>A:	Geez. Is that all?</p>

<p>A:	So you are saying that I should eat, but I should</p>
<p>just watch what I eat?</p>
<p>B:	Yes! You can also try to reduce your intake of carbohydrates and foods that are high in cholesterol. You can have steamed veggies or increase your protein intake found in chicken or fish.</p>

<p>A:	Did you set your clock forward for daylight savings time?</p>
<p>B:	What? Why do we have to do that?</p>
<p>A:	Well, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.</p>
<p>B:	I see. That’s convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!</p>
<p>A:	That just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, then we were in</p>
<p>China Standard Time, and that’s eight time zones east of Greenwich!</p>
<p>B:	That’s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA! Because of the huge time difference, even though we left Beijing at noon and flew for more than</p>
<p>eight hours, we still arrived in LA the same day at noon! It’s like we went back in time!</p>

<p>Mike: Thank you, Bob! This past week has been the beginning of Armageddon for many, a series of unprecedented meteorological events occurred around the world. In Switzerland, a major avalanche was reported in the Alps. Fortunately, no one was injured. Due to to the extreme cold this winter, a blizzard has struck the US Midwest, causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled.</p>
<p>Mike: Moving to to Latin American, Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming, but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country. In Chile, a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region. Losses are reported to be in the billions. Authorities have not yet released an official statement.</p>
<p>Bob: Not a great week for the world! Any good news?</p>
<p>Mike: I’m afraid not, Bob. One of the major volcanoes in Mexico has erupted, causing major floods and landslides in the region. Meanwhile, Mexico ’s coast has been hit by hurricane Liliana and officials say that all the seismic activity leads them to believe that a tsunami may hit Central America, affecting Honduras, Guatemala and Panama.

<p>Je: Joanne, let’s not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is, okay? Let’s just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly, so we can go our separate ways, alright?</p>
<p>Joanne: Fine with me. I just want to get this over</p>
<p>with. It’s important we make a clean break. I should</p>
<p>have signed a pre-nup.</p>
<p>Je: What was that?</p>
<p>Joanne: Nothing! Anyway, you’re right, there’s no reason this has to be nasty. My lawyer tells me you’ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement- I keep the cat and you get the dog. So that’s done. . . . finally.</p>
<p>Je: Let’s not go there, Joanne! Ok, so let’s start with the record collection, I’ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.</p>
<p>Joanne: Fine, but I’m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.</p>
<p>Je: I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne. And you hardly ever use it!</p>
<p>Joanne: He’s my grandfather, and he never really liked you anyway!</p>
<p>Je: Whatever! Alright, I’ll concede the silly gramophone, if you’ll agree that I get the silver tea set.</p>
<p>Joanne:How typical, when are you ever going to use a silver tea set? Fine! I don’t want to drag this out any longer than necessary. What’s next? What about these old photographs?</p>
<p>Je: Which ones? Let me have a look. Wow, look at that! That brings back memories. . . . That? Joanne:Our trip to Italy! I remember that day. We were going to visit the Trevi fountain, and we got caught in the rain. . . .</p>
<p>Je: . . . and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet. I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing in the rain. . . .</p>
<p>Joanne: Oh, we really did have fun back then didn’t we?</p>
<p>Je: Oh, Joanne, are we making a big mistake? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can’t reconcile and try again? I still love you.</p>
<p>Joanne:Oh Jeff! I love you too! I’m so glad we didn’t have to decide who keeps the motorcycle.</p>
<p>Je: The motorcycle? But that’s mine!</p>

<p>A:	A highchair and car seat! Wow Betty thank you so much! I really appreciate it!</p>
<p>B:	One more from Carla.</p>
<p>A:	A playpen and crib! Thanks Carla! This is just what I needed!</p>
<p>B:	OK, that’s all of them. No more gifts. Now who wants to guess when the baby is due!</p>

<p>B:	Fine! I am going to go home and drop off this nightstand, coffee table and love seat while you look for the rest of the things.</p>
<p>A:	Great! Pick me up in about an hour because I think I’ll also get a bean bag and a dining set.</p>
<p>B:	While you are at it can you pick out a nice recliner? I really want one so I can watch TV.</p>

<p>A:	Hold on, before you kick your car let’s go through some possible problems.</p>
<p>B:	Fine.</p>
<p>A:	Ok, first of all, can you turn the key in the ignition?</p>
<p>B:	Yeah! I am here with my friend and he thinks it may be the spark plug or the starter motor.</p>
<p>A:	Those are possible problems, but tell me, when you turn the key, do you hear the starter motor crank?</p>
<p>B:	Yeah, it sounds like it usually does when I start the car, but nothing else happens. The engine won’t start. Should I maybe press the accelerator?</p>
<p>A:	No. If you step on the accelerator pedal you can flood the carburetor and your car will never start.</p>
<p>B:	So what do you think it is?</p>
<p>A:	I know this may seem like a silly question, but does your car have gasoline?</p>
<p>B:	Umm. yeah! Right! I got the car started! Thanks for your help! I told you to fill the tank!</p>
<h2 id="elementary--global-view--carbon-footprint-c0222">Elementary ‐ Global View ‐ Carbon Footprint (C0222)</h2>
<p>A:	So what’s your guys’ take on all this global warming hysteria in the media?</p>
<p>B:	It’s pretty serious, man. There have been tons of scientific studies and the scientific community says that the earth is heating up. We need to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle if we want to preserve our planet.</p>
<p>A:	I don’t know. It sounds like a bunch of mumbo</p>
<p>jumbo if you ask me. ”Save the earth!” The earth will save itself. It’s survived worst disasters in the past. I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies. There’s no way anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to work, especially in the winter. And we have no bus system. My house is forty years old and it would take a lot of money to get it refitted to be ”green” and ”energy-efficient”.</p>
<p>C:	Well I don’t really know if I believe in global warming either, or whether or not it was our doing or a natural change the earth is going through, but you have to admit that we’re living pretty irresponsibly here in the west.</p>
<p>A:	I guess&hellip;</p>
<p>C:	I think the issue at hand is sustainability. We’ve only got this one earth we can live on, and our resources are quickly disappearing because of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but ourselves and anything but the present.</p>
<p>B:	So, like I was saying, we need to change the way we live. We need to reduce our carbon footprint.</p>
<p>C:	But it doesn’t have to be that drastic. Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too expensive to be feasible right now. And we don’t have to be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either, though it helps.</p>
<p>B:	I car pool to work everyday with some buddies of mine. I have a rain barrel outside my house I use to water my plants and my lawn in the summer, and I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get my groceries. And we just started using bio-degradable plastic made from corn oil for take-out orders at my family’s restaurant. Remember the three R’s? Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.</p>
<p>C:	Exactly, it’s just small simple changes, like buying energy-saving light bulbs, starting a compost bin, recycling bottles and papers, using reusable water bottles, stop using disposable cups and cutlery.</p>
<p>A:	Like the ones we’re drinking out of?</p>
<p>B:	Yeah.</p>

We received a call from the Bear family at around ten thirty this morning. They had gone out for a walk before breakfast and came home to this mess! Broken chairs and porridge all over the place!

<p>Detective MeGee: Okay then, let’s start examining the evidence. . . . Have the forensics team been in yet?</p>
<p>McGraw: Yes sir. They found some fingerprints on the bowls and are analyzing them back at the lab as we speak. Hopefully, they will be able to identify the burglar soon.</p>

<p>floor. . . . this mess. interesting. These footprints seem to lead upstairs. McGraw, did your officers clear the scene?</p>

<p>B:	I don’t know why anyone would want what’s in this catalog anyway. It’s just a bunch of tacky Christmas ornaments, Cd’s of old people singing</p>
<p>Christmas songs, and special crackers and cheeses and boxes of chocolates.</p>

<p>A:	She what?</p>
<p>B:	Oh don’t worry sweetie, I didn’t know when you were going to propose. It was still a nice surprise! As</p>
<p>I was saying, I’ve got it all planned out. There’s almost nothing left to do! I wrote up our guest list and we will have roughly four hundred guests attending.</p>
<p>A:	four hundred?</p>
<p>B:	No need to sweat it. My parents agreed to pay for most of the wedding, which is going to be low budget anyway. So roughly four hundred people, which means that the hall at Northwood Heights will be our reception venue. I thought it would be nice if we had the wedding at your parents’ church and my uncle of course would be officiating. We’ll meet with him soon for some pre-wedding counseling. The music for the wedding ceremony was a no-brainer. My step-sister and her string quartet will take care of that. My cousin will be the official photographer. I thought it would also be nice if his daughter could sing a solo.</p>
<p>Did you know that she’s going to be a professional opera singer?</p>
<p>A:	Ah&hellip;</p>
<p>B:	And then of course the ladies at the church would love to be our caterers for the banquet and we’ll get the Youth Group to serve us. I was thinking that your friend’s band could be our entertainment for the night. though they might have to tone it down a bit.</p>
<p>Or we could hire a DJ. Your sister’s husband could get us a discount with that company that does the decor at weddings. What’s their name again? I was thinking that we could have an island paradise-themed wedding and our theme color would be a soothing blue like Aquamarine.</p>
<p>And there will be a huge seashell on the wall behind the podium where we’ll make our toasts! What do you think of small packages of drink mixes for our wedding favors? Who else am I missing? Oh, your uncle could be our florist and his wife could make our wedding cake!</p>

<p>A:	Trading? You, big guy? What are you trading?</p>
<p>B:	Currencies.</p>
<p>A:	Currencies? As in Euros, Dollars, Pounds and Rupees?</p>
<p>B:	It’s called Forex. Foreign Exchange. The great thing about it is that I don’t have to invest a huge amount. I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much!</p>
<p>A:	I don’t understand. You’re buying and selling money?</p>
<p>B:	You got it! Just last night I made USD 150!</p>
<p>A:	Last night?</p>
<p>B:	Yeah! It’s a 24 hour market! I had bought some</p>
<p>RMB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RMB at an amazing bid! I’ve also done some trading with CHF and AUD and HKD.</p>
<p>I’ve made some good profits but I’ve also suffered some losses. It depends on a lot of factors just like any other market. In total I’ve made about USD 500 in the past few months.</p>

<p>Chloe: Hi, Dr Evans. Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. When I woke up this morning I had a</p>
<p>really sore throat and a really bad cough. I think I am coming down with the flu.</p>
<p>Doctor Evans:Ah I see, yes you do sound rather croaky. Well let’s have a look, shall we? Could you please open your mouth and say ” ah”. Chloe: ”Ahhhhhhhh”</p>
<p>Doctor Evans: Good, yes, your tonsils are a little swollen and red. How are your ears, blocked at all? Chloe: A little actually. My sinuses are a little blocked up as well – I really feel terrible.</p>
<p>Doctor Evans: Ok Chloe, can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest? You really are all bunged up, you don’t sound too good at all. Ok I’m going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics. You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening. You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals. Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless. . . just to clear up your lungs!</p>
<p>Chloe: Whoa! So many drugs. . . . I hate swallowing pills. Am I able to go to work?</p>
<p>Doctor Evans: Absolutely not! You are highly contagious! You don’t want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don’t get weak and dehydrated. You can catch up on all the latest tv shows and movies!</p>

<p>Jill: Alex, what’s up with you? You look dreadful!</p>
<p>Alex: Hey Jill, I don’t know. I’ve been having trouble sleeping these past few weeks. I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep . I’ve tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to bed . I’ve tried eating and not eating different foods. I’ve even tried counting sheep! And then when I finally get to sleep , I have these really disturbing nightmares, so I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep .</p>
<p>Jill: Wow, maybe you should get that checked out. Maybe you’re stressed?</p>
<p>C:	Just take some sedatives! Works for me! Every so often having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping. It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders. It’s the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns.</p>
<p>Jill: I heard of that. But does that apply to Alex’s situation?</p>
<p>C:	Ya sure, why not? Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since it’s a recent thing so taking melatonin do the trick.</p>
<p>Jill: But shouldn’t he be looking into WHY it’s been happening?</p>
<p>C:	Well aren’t you the little psychologist? Our buddy’s having trouble sleeping, it’s easy and curable. It’s not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker.</p>

<p>Jacob: Stephanie! Did you just get to school? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning! That was about an hour and a half ago. This happens all the time! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning?</p>
<p>Stephanie: It’s a skill. What can I say? I don’t know why, I just have a long routine.</p>
<p>Jacob: Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl’s routine be so complicated? You get up, you shower, you get dressed , you brush your teeth, you’re out the door. Half an hour, tops.</p>
<p>Stephanie: Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it’s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning. In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I’ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blowdry it straight. And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That’s another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.</p>
<p>Jacob: True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?</p>
<p>Stephanie: Not funny.</p>

<p>Rebecca: Thank you very much. I’ve tried to keep it</p>
<p>short and clear. If there’s any questions please feel free to ask me.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Well yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I’d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.</p>
<p>Rebecca: yes of course. Well as you can see from the resume I’m up and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around rook.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Ah I see, so you were actually educated in Europe?</p>
<p>Rebecca: yes precisely. Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home. But as you see I’ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country. My Father was inthe oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Very interesting. So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.</p>
<p>Rebecca: Absolutely! We were never still for too long. But now I’m really looking to settle down. Mr. Parsons: I see. Okay, well let’s move on to discuss your education shall we?</p>

<p>Rebecca: Yes, that’s right. To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me. I was really just treated more like an intern. I didn’t have many responsibilities and I found it quite frustrating.</p>

<p>The Weekend ‐ Making A Sandwich (C0249)</p>
<p>A:	Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’s get started !</p>
<p>A:	Let’s start with the basics :bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing -choose the bread according to the following criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.</p>
<p>A:	Now that our bread is ready, let’s talk about the ingredients ! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.</p>
<p>A:	Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in</p>
<p>forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident- cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs-you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.</p>
<p>A:	Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!</p>
<p>A:	That’s all the time we have for today, but join us</p>
<p>next time where we’ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next time!</p>

<p>B:	Are you crazy! You have no idea what you are talking about! Just for my eyes I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow, an eyebrow pencil and mascara. Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.</p>
<p>A:	Whoa whoa whoa! Are you nuts? How much is all this going to cost? I’m looking at the price at each</p>

<p>A:	Now I want everyone to take this class seriously, sexual education is very important and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think of. Remember, there are no stupid questions here.</p>
<p>B:	Miss Carlton? What exactly is sexual education? Are you going to teach us like Kama sutra stuff like that?</p>
<p>A:	No  Jason,  that’s  not  exactly  what  sex  ed  is.</p>
<p>Basically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives and how the male and female bodies work.</p>
<p>B:	My older sister is in college and she takes what she and her friends call the pill. I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something.</p>
<p>A:	Good point Jason! This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives. As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist. The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STD’s from an infected person.</p>
<p>Another popular method is using condoms. This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant but also protects both from STD’s. Yes Jason?</p>
<p>B:	What are condoms made out of? How exactly is it that a woman gets pregnant?</p>
<p>A:	Condoms are usually made out of an elastic material called Latex. As for your other question, that’s a whole new class.</p>

<p>Mr. Parsons: Definitely, but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be?</p>
<p>Rebecca: Well as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don’t see progress in my work or career. I suppose I’m quite a restless character. My father always taught me to be a high achiever so.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: So would you say if things don’t go your way at work it could easily get you down? Rebecca: Well, in a way yes. But I must say that even if I’m not completely happy in my work I always give 110% I would never shirk my responsibilities. I suppose sometimes Iexpect too much too soon. Mr. Parsons: Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself it’s true. Okay well lets move on to talk about the job position here shall we? Rebecca: Yes please.</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ Making Breakfast (C0254)</p>
<p>A:	Smells good! What’s for breakfast?</p>
<p>B:	Well, since we are getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast!</p>
<p>A:	Nice! Brunch!</p>
<p>B:	Kind of, so I made scrambled and soft boiled eggs, some french toast and buttermilk pancakes!</p>
<p>A:	Wow! You really went all out! Did you make any coffee?</p>
<p>B:	Yeah, just the way you like it! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.</p>
<p>A:	Looks good! I’ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.</p>
<p>B:	Get the jam and butter while you are in there! Oh!</p>
<p>And don’t forget the syrup!</p>
<p>Global View ‐ The Miracle Of Life (C0255)</p>
<p>A:	Continuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the miracle of life. Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I am sure that some of the things that we will be talking about today may surprise you. Billy can you turn on the projector please? Thanks. Ok, does anyone know what this is?</p>
<p>B:	Looks like a goat head to me!</p>
<p>A: Nice  try,  but  this  is  a  woman’s  womb  which</p>
<p>contains her uterus and ovaries. The ovaries are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of your cycle. In an average 28 day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days, counting day 1 as the first day of your last period.</p>
<p>B:	That’s amazing! So each month, the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?</p>
<p>A:	Actually, every woman is already born with over four hundred thousand eggs! Some will start dying off immediately and others released during her fertile period.</p>
<p>B:	What about the guys? I know they produce sperm and stuff.</p>
<p>A:	That’s right! The man’s body has a tiny factory that produces sperm twenty four hours a day! Each ejaculation will release about a hundred million sperm so the factory is always pretty busy. The sole purpose of a sperm’s life is to fertilize the woman’s egg.</p>
<p>B:	So, then we basically need to put one-and-one together so we can have babies right?</p>
<p>A:	Yes, the man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen. Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix, through the uterus to the fallopian tubes. This could take anywhere from forty five minutes to twelve hours! Not all of them make it, since some go the wrong way and get lost or simply die. Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it. Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside.</p>
<p>B:	And then? That’s it?</p>
<p>A:	Well, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release. The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing. The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells, known as the embryo, travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus. Any other questions? Then let’s move on.</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Interview Skills 8 ‐ Discussing S</p>
<p>alary and Benefits (C0256)</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Okay, well I’m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position.</p>
<p>Rebecca: Yes, well Miss Childs did give me an overview of the position over the phone, but there were some details I’d like to clarify.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Well feel free to ask me anything, and I’ll try to fill in the details.</p>
<p>Rebecca: Could I first ask about the remuneration package?</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Yes of course. That’s quite an important point isn’t it? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum. This doesn’t include a generous housing allowance also.</p>
<p>Rebecca: I understand. And are there other bonuses included?</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Well apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers. But we could go through all the details of that at a later date.</p>
<p>Rebecca: Well Mr. Parsons, I am flexible when it comes to salary. The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Excellent. Well, what other questions do you have Rebecca?</p>
<p>Global View ‐ The World Cup (C0257)</p>
<p>A:	What are you doing?</p>
<p>B:	What am I doing? What am I doing? Don’t you know what day it is?</p>
<p>A:	Ummm. no.</p>
<p>B:	It’s only the day when the world’s biggest sporting event is kicking off.</p>
<p>A:	What?</p>
<p>B:	The World Cup! The first match is today! It’s Mexico vs. South Africa! It’s going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country, and all.</p>
<p>A:	I have no idea what you’re talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>B:	This is bigger than the Super Bowl, man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every</p>
<p>four years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, each group having 4 teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarterfinals and semifinals.</p>
<p>A:	Sounds interesting, but soccer doesn’t really appeal to me.</p>
<p>B:	Are you kidding? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup! It’s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion. So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt; they’re really good!</p>
<p>A:	All I know about soccer is that you can’t use your hands and that players are always falling down, trying to get a free kick or penalty kick. It seems like a sissy sport to me!</p>
<p>B:	Whatever dude, I’m going to go watch the opening match.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ You’re Grounded! (C0258)</p>
<p>A:	Do you know what time it is?</p>
<p>B:	Um. Ten?</p>
<p>A:	Get in this door young man. It’s midnight, you are two hours past curfew.</p>
<p>B:	I know, but it wasn’t my fault! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten, but she wouldn’t leave the party!</p>
<p>A:	I don’t care! You are grounded for life mister!</p>
<p>B:	Mom! That is so unfair!</p>
<p>A:	You know the rules and you broke them. No allowance and no TV for a week. I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down!</p>
<p>B:	What! For being a couple of hours late? You have to be kidding!</p>
<p>A:	I don’t want to hear it! Now go to your room!</p>
<p>About The Position (C0259)</p>
<p>Rebecca: Could you tell me a little about the organization?</p>
<p>For example, how big is your</p>
<p>workforce here?</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing. The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff.</p>
<p>Rebecca: I see. And how about the working hours?</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Well, as you know Rebecca, in journalism work hours are not exactly 9-5. You could be on call at any time. We do have to work very unsociable hours at times. Rebecca: Well I am used to that Mr. Parsons, so that’s not really a shock for me.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Good, as long as you understand that. Rebecca: And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr. Parsons?</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Yesterday! But no, we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month. Rebecca: That sounds ideal.</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ Guns (C0260)</p>
<p>A:	Hey Nick, what are you up to?</p>
<p>B:	Not much, just heading over to the shooting range. You wanna come?</p>
<p>A:	Seriously? You mean to fire a real weapon? I don’t know man.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah it will be fun! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot. I also have a revolver that’s really fun too! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah that would be cool! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile! Or what about a flame thrower!</p>
<p>B:	Whoa, take it easy there Rambo. Don’t get carried away. These weapons are not toys, and you must first learn how to handle them properly. There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe. For example, never handle a weapon that you haven’t inspected yourself. Always make sure there isn’t anything in the chamber, and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot!</p>
<p>A:	Wow, I didn’t know! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies!</p>
<p>B:	The reality is different you know, running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies! So are you ready?</p>
<p>A:	Let’s do it!</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Describing Someone’s Face (C026 1)</p>
<p>A:	Let’s play a game!</p>
<p>B:	Ok! How about Scrabble?</p>
<p>A:	No no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game. I’m going to describe someone’s face, and you guess who it is!</p>
<p>B:	Ok!</p>
<p>A:	Let’s see. He has a roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples!</p>
<p>B:	Our cousin Pete! My turn! She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes and a mole on her chin!</p>
<p>A:	Aunt Rose! That mole is so huge! Ok, my turn. He has a crooked nose and full lips. He has quite a few freckles and an oval face. Oh, he is also bald!</p>
<p>B:	Your future husband!</p>
<p>A:	Not funny.</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Interview Skills 10 ‐ Concluding The Interview (C0262)</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Well Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for now?</p>
<p>Rebecca: I don’t think so Mr. Parsons. I think you have covered all the main points for me.</p>
<p>Mr Parsons: Okay well listen, here is my business card with my mobile number. If any other questions spring to mind don’t hesitate to contact me. Of course you can also call Miss Childs too.</p>
<p>Rebecca: Great. Ermm, when can I expect to hear from you?</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Well, we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow, so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week. Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday. How does that sound?</p>
<p>Rebecca: That sounds perfect. Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr. Parsons. Mr. Parsons: The pleasure’s all mine Rebecca.</p>
<p>Rebecca: I hope to hear from you very soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Parsons: Absolutely. Thanks for coming Rebecca. Goodbye.</p>
<p>Global View ‐ Nationalities (C0263)</p>
<p>A:	Hey! How was your first day of class? I’m in level two and I’m loving my class this semester! It’s great being in a class of international students!</p>
<p>B:	Mine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester.</p>
<p>A:	That’s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’s the</p>
<p>United Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, we also</p>
<p>have a Moroccan, a Togolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians!</p>
<p>B:	That’s quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian.</p>
<p>A:	Well, I think you’re pretty lucky actually. You’ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.</p>
<p>B:	I guess so, but I think it’s going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes.</p>
<p>A:	Don’t! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.</p>
<p>B:	I highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese.</p>
<p>A:	Well, there is that, yes.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Toothache (C0264)</p>
<p>A:	What seems to be the problem?</p>
<p>B:	I have a really bad toothache! My cheek is swollen and I can’t eat anything.</p>
<p>A:	Let’s have a look. Hmmm. This doesn’t look too good. I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth. It’s pressing against your molars and that’s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.</p>
<p>B:	When you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?</p>
<p>A:	First we will take some x-rays and see what we’re dealing with. I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.</p>
<p>B:	I guess that’s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.</p>
<p>A:	It could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets. In any case, I’ll administer an anesthetic and you won’t feel a thing!</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ Pest Control (C0265)</p>
<p>A:	Hi, did you call for an exterminator?</p>
<p>B:	Yes! Thank goodness you’re here. These bugs are driving us crazy!</p>
<p>A:	What sort of pest are we dealing with?</p>
<p>B:	We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything. We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard!</p>
<p>A:	Well, there’s nothing we can’t handle. I’ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will be harder to get rid of. We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it. Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.</p>
<p>B:	No problem, just get rid of the bugs!</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Weather Report (C0266)</p>
<p>A:	Those are today’s top stories. Now let’s go to John for the weather. John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?</p>
<p>B:	I’m afraid we’re in for a rough weekend, Mark.</p>
<p>There is a storm system moving through the East</p>
<p>Coast. It will be drizzling all day today, and there’s a</p>
<p>60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening. It will be warm and humid all weekend. In the Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees.</p>
<p>A:	That’s pretty chilly for the summer! Will it rain on Saturday?</p>
<p>B:	Unfortunately, yes. It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day. There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast. Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls.</p>
<p>A:	That certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.</p>
<p>B:	It gets better on Sunday, though. The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night. It will still be rather cool, with highs in the low 50s. The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather, but at least the sun will come out. I advise weekend travelers to be careful, especially while driving. Back to you, Mark.</p>
<p>A:	Thanks John, and there you have it! Looks like it’s a weekend to stay at home!</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Making A Bank Transfer (C0267)</p>
<p>A:	Good Morning welcome to Bank of the USA. How may I help you today?</p>
<p>B:	Hi I need to transfer some money to another account. It’s urgent.</p>
<p>A:	Okay, have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?</p>
<p>B:	No. I’ve never made a transfer before.</p>
<p>A:	It’s alright, I will take you through the procedure.</p>
<p>Are  you  transferring  funds  to  a  company  or  an</p>
<p>individual account?</p>
<p>B:	A company account. I need to pay a bill.</p>
<p>A:	Okay, I’ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank’s address and phone number.</p>
<p>B:	I have all the information in this folder.</p>
<p>A:	Well You’ve come prepared .You have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now. It’s a simple transaction, and we can process it today.</p>
<p>B:	Oh, that’s such a relief. I didn’t want the payment to be overdue. Thank you so much .</p>
<p>A:	It’s my pleasure.</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Purchasing Manager (C0268)</p>
<p>A:	Good morning, Angela, how have you been lately?</p>
<p>B:	Morning, Michael. I’ve been very busy lately. One of our other vendors is going out of business and I’ve been searching for a suitable replacement.</p>
<p>A:	Well, rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run sit down. Coffee?</p>
<p>B:	No, thanks. I’ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .</p>
<p>A:	Haha, I could never do that. I’d be a zombie if I didn’t have my morning coffee fix. Let’s get down to business then.</p>
<p>B:	Yes. I’ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new MePhone. The demand for phone cameras is growing, and Pear has been falling behind in the market.</p>
<p>A:	That’s great! I’m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon. Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras. Is Pear still interested in having those?</p>
<p>B:	No, we’re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels. We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal.</p>
<p>A:	Surely. Let’s get started by drafting a new contract.</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Marketing Plan (C0269)</p>
<p>A:	Okay everyone, let’s begin. I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession. I wanted to re-emphasize our corporate mission of Aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.</p>
<p>B:	Several other shops have reduced the prices for their coffees and are drawing in more customers.</p>
<p>Why aren’t we doing the same thing?</p>
<p>A:	I know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the level of our competitors. We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than shortterm sales. If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.</p>
<p>B:	Customers don’t care about the coffee anymore.</p>
<p>They only care about the price.</p>
<p>A:	I disagree. Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places. Our coffee bean are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees. When you compare the coffees side-by-side our coffee wins the taste test every time. We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks, and we will not do so now.</p>
<p>C:	That’s true. We’ve certainly achieved top of mind awareness when it comes to the best best tasting brews and it’s important to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. I think the main question is how we can show our appreciation to our customers.</p>
<p>A:	That’s the main question I would like to discuss today.</p>
<p>B:	Money is tight for everyone these days so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee. Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies why don’t we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home.</p>
<p>C:	That could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?</p>
<p>A:	Let’s brainstorm some more ideas, and do some research. The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets. Maybe it’s time we started selling coffee beans.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Buying A Suit (C0270)</p>
<p>A:	Hello sir, what can I do for you today?</p>
<p>B:	Hi, I need a new suit. I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.</p>
<p>A:	No problem! We have a broad selection of suits, all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly.</p>
<p>B:	Great! I want a three piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.</p>
<p>A:	Very well sir. Would you like to have some shirts</p>
<p>made also?</p>
<p>B:	Sure. I’ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties.</p>
<p>A:	Very good. Now, if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 1 ‐ The Over view and the Agenda (C0271)</p>
<p>A:	Hi everyone, Can everyone hear me?Can you guys at the back hear everything?</p>
<p>A:	Okay great. Well I think all of you know why we are here this afternoon. As most of you are aware 2010 marks an important moment for Alpha computers.</p>
<p>A:	We have bounced back from the recession and now we are set to launch our new line of laptop and desktop computers.</p>
<p>A:	I’m really pleased to welcome Michael Ford, the</p>
<p>Global Marketing Manager for Alpha computers, who has flown in from California to give all of you an overview of the marketing campaign and to answer any questions you may have. So please give a warm welcome to Mr. Ford.</p>
<p>B:	Thank you Jonathan. It really is a pleasure to be here today. It has been three years since I visited</p>
<p>Beijing ,and it’s clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.</p>
<p>B:	The Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China, and that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here. So congratulations to all of you.</p>
<p>B:	I’d like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed. The presentation today is divided into five main parts.</p>
<p>B:	First of all, I’d like to briefly touch on the background of the new x420 line; how the whole concept has come about and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.</p>
<p>B:	Secondly I’dlike to present data on projected sales for the x420. We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector. Then I would like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the x420.</p>
<p>B:	Finally I’m happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you might have for me.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Getting A Nanny (C0272)</p>
<p>Grace: Hey Mel! Are you up for some tennis today?</p>
<p>Mel: Sorry, I can’t! I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.</p>
<p>Grace: You sound exhausted. Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities. She can also help you do some household chores, and run some errands.</p>
<p>Mel: Oh, I don’t know&hellip; it’s hard to find the right nanny .You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have someone to help me out, though.</p>
<p>Grace: I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won’t have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you’ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to work for my neighbors, before they moved away. She’s very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.</p>
<p>Mel: Oh, that’s great. Thanks Grace. Can you give me her number? I’ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way I won’t be so tired every day, and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while .</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ The Zodiac and Horoscopes ( C0273)</p>
<p>Angela: Hey Lydia, what are you reading?</p>
<p>Lydia: I’m looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, and that I will have a passionate summer fling!</p>
<p>Angela: What are you talking about? Let me see that. . . What are horoscopes?</p>
<p>Lydia: It’s a prediction of your month, based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I’m an Aries. When were you born?</p>
<p>Angela: January 5th.</p>
<p>Lydia: Let’s see. . . you’re a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we’ll both have interesting summers!</p>
<p>Angela: That’s bogus. I don’t feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This</p>
<p>zodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.</p>
<p>Lydia: No it’s not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize. Angela: Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they’re so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?</p>
<p>Lydia: A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. * laughs * That sounds just like you!</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 2 ‐ Talking about numbers, charts and graphs (C0274)</p>
<p>Mr Ford: As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.</p>
<p>Mr Ford: We continue to fight with our competitors for market share, and this is the case both in the developed markets in the West, as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>Mr Ford: You may ask yourself, why is this market so cut-throat? Well the answer is simple. There is a huge untapped potential market out there, with a huge untapped potential for profit.</p>
<p>Mr Ford: If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.</p>
<p>Mr Ford: As you can see in the 1980’s computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world population. Since the 1990’s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.</p>
<p>Mr Ford: In the new millennium we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners , with figures rising to around 4- 5%, an increase of 1000 % percent compared with the 1980’s .</p>
<p>Mr Ford: If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically we can see in Chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.</p>
<p>Mr Ford: Now of course 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China, and this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.</p>
<p>Mr Ford: For us at Alpha, and of course for all our competitors as well, we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.</p>
<p>Mr Ford: If we do this right we really can reap huge</p>
<p>rewards in a very short time frame. I’d now like to move on to discuss the x420 brand itself, and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Kitchen Appliances (C0275)</p>
<p>A:	I have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven’t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need!</p>
<p>B:	What are you getting?</p>
<p>A:	Well, the first thing on my list is a new blender. I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker.</p>
<p>B:	Don’t forget to also get a new mixer. I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah I know. I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one. I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies.</p>
<p>B:	I’m actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove, oven, dishwasher and trash compacter.</p>
<p>A:	That’s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing!</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Telephone Services (C0276)</p>
<p>A:	Telco Mobile, how can I help you?</p>
<p>B:	Yes, I’d like to activate my voice mail service please.</p>
<p>A:	Certainly sir, we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services, call waiting and also three way calling.</p>
<p>B:	Sure that sounds great! Are there any other fees?</p>
<p>A:	Not at all. No hidden fees or surcharges, it is a flat monthly rate.</p>
<p>B:	Perfect. I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number.</p>
<p>A:	Yes of course. We can activate all these services in about an hour.</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 3 ‐ Making Comparisons (C0277)</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Now a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new x420 line with our previous models, and also of course with some of our competitors.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: In other words what makes the x420 stand out from all the others? This is a key question, and is something I’d like to explore in a little depth.</p>
<p>Firstly, the x420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: The first thing to mention is that the x420 is the first in a new generation of ultralight laptop computers. It is only 2lbs, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors. In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine it’s very powerful. 4Gb of RAM, with an ultra-fast processor.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal-clear 15-inch LCD display. The x420 really stands out as next generation laptop. Compared with our previous x540 range it really is in a league of its own .</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Now, if we go on to look at projected sales for the x420 we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least 20 million dollars. Now this is really a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: If our marketing campaign is successful I’m confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least. Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: I’m certain that in the coming three years the x420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue. Okay, now let’s move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.</p>
<p>Global View ‐ At The Car Dealership (C0278)</p>
<p>A:	Hi there! I am looking for a new car. I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.</p>
<p>B:	I see. You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it’s the end of the year,</p>
<p>A:	Perfect! I like this one.</p>
<p>B:	That is the Ford Focus. A very light but powerful vehicle. It comes with dual side airbags, power steering and power windows, tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission.</p>
<p>A:	Sounds like a good car! How many miles to the gallon?</p>
<p>B:	It is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about</p>
<p>34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway.</p>
<p>A:	That is really convenient. Especially now that fuel prices are so high! What’s under the hood?</p>
<p>B:	A very powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged engine, Trust me, this car is fast!</p>
<p>A:	Now for the most difficult question. What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?</p>
<p>B:	Very affordable sir. You can take it out of this lot today with 0% down payment and no interest for the first year! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.</p>
<p>A:	Great! Let’s do it!</p>
<p>Global View ‐ Drugs (C0279)</p>
<p>A:	Hey man, you wanna buy some weed?</p>
<p>B:	Some what?</p>
<p>A:	Weed! You know? Pot, Ganja, Mary Jane some chronic!</p>
<p>B:	Oh, umm, no thanks.</p>
<p>A:	I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.</p>
<p>B:	No, I am ok, really.</p>
<p>A:	Come on man! I even got dope and acid! Try some!</p>
<p>B:	Do you really have all of these drugs? Where do you get them from?</p>
<p>A:	I got my connections! Just tell me what you want and I’ll even give you one ounce for free.</p>
<p>B:	Sounds good! Let’s see, I want.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah?</p>
<p>B:	I want you to put your hands behind your head! You are under arrest!</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 4 ‐ Discussi ng the</p>
<p>Competition (C0280)</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Now, of course, with all this cutting-edge technology there must be a catch, you might ask yourself. I bet the retail price will be too much for most consumers, you might say. Well, you’d be wrong!</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Yes, of course the x420 is aimed at the luxury market, but if you compare the price of our leading competitors, the x420 represents incredible value for money. At only15,000RMB it is far more affordable and far more attractive than almost every leading brand and model.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: So, what differentiates us from our competitors? Well, if we compare Orange’s luxury MP40 range then we can really highlight some of the differences.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Now, of course Orange has an enviable record for producing revolutionary and top class products, and I must admit the MP40 is a breathtaking machine. However, for most consumers the MP40 is simply far too expensive to consider.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Compared with the x420 it is more expensive and there’s no doubt that considering the quality and workmanship that goes into the x420 we really win hands down on value for money.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Also, if you compare the after sales service we offer I think we can proudly boast the best customer service facilities in the whole lap-top sector. As opposed to most of our rivals, we guarantee quality, we guarantee service and we guarantee reliability.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: The questions we must ask ourselves are ” What does the Alpha brand stand for? and also ” How can we set ourselves apart from our competitors? The answer to both of these questions is the same my friends.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Alpha stands first and foremost for quality, for excellence and for service. If we always stick to this philosophy then I’m confident that we will really be able to expand our market share significantly. Okay, let me move on now to give you an idea of our marketing campaign for the x420</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ Breaking Up (C0281)</p>
<p>Lydia: Hello?</p>
<p>Maggie: Hey! Do you want to go out tonight?</p>
<p>Lydia: No, I think I’ll pass. Mark broke up with me. I feel awful.</p>
<p>Maggie: What?!? What happened? Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together! Lydia: I don’t know what I did wrong. He said he needed some space to figure things out&hellip; He said I didn’t do anything wrong, that I’m a great person&hellip;</p>
<p>just not the one for him&hellip;</p>
<p>Maggie: Ugh! That’s so cliche. Mark’s not worth your time, Lydia. You deserve so much better!</p>
<p>Lydia: I know we had hit a rough patch but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend, when we both had some time off&hellip; I think he found someone else. I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a coworker&hellip;</p>
<p>Maggie: Whatever. He’s a jerk, forget about him! There are many more fish in the sea.</p>
<p>Lydia: Talk about being clich ′ e, Maggie! But you’re</p>
<p>right. There’s no use for me to sulk around&hellip; Let’s go out tonight!</p>
<p>Global View ‐ Physics (C0282)</p>
<p>Prof. Brown: Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Physics 101. My name is Ed Brown, and I will be your professor for this semester. Since today is our first class, I wanted to give you an overview of what this course will look like, how you will be graded, and what we will cover this semester.</p>
<p>Matt: Will we be focusing more on theoretical physics or experimental physics, Professor?</p>
<p>Prof. Brown: This is an introductory course, and my aim is to give you a broad overview of the field of physics. The term “ physics” encompasses many different areas of research and study, and I hope this course will provide you with conceptual understanding of physics, which will prove useful whether or not you choose to further your study in this field.</p>
<p>Prof. Brown: We will begin the course by looking at the fundamental concepts of physics, then by the middle of the semester we will begin exploring the more theoretical side of physics. It is essential that you first have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, so that you can better understand the theoretical concepts when we get to them. Matt: Will we learn about black holes, wormholes, and string theory?</p>
<p>Prof. Brown: We will learn about the general theory of relativity, including black holes. We will also explore developing theories in quantum mechanics, such as string theory. We will discuss some hypothetical features of space-time, like wormholes. Prof. Brown: We will also explore some of the more influential developments in the fields of thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and nuclear physics, all of which have had significant impacts on modern life. Now, I am going to have the TAs pass out the syllabus for this class, so you can see how this course will be graded.</p>
<p>Matt: Oh man, looks like this isn’t gonna be the easy A I thought it’d be!</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 5 ‐ Deferrin g Questions (C0283)</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Now, as we have already discussed there is a huge untapped market out there both in Asia, in other developing markets, and in the more mature markets for us to push into. Now of course, this represents an enormous challenge with enormous</p>
<p>rewards for the winners, but for any new product we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer, and needs to be pitched at exactly the right level. The question we must first address is of course, who is our target consumer and secondly what do they expect from the next generation Alpha lap-top?</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Let’s first of all tackle the first question. Our target consumer for the x420 is the middle class, white collar worker with an above average income. However, as we mentioned before the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly and we need to broaden our audience for this product.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: For example, the x420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector, who might use laptops both for study and gaming. There is no doubt that.</p>
<p>Audience Member: Mr. Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment. You say that the computer is suitable for students, but don’t you think the price of the x420 is just too much for most students?</p>
<p>Mr Ford: Well, that’s a fair point. If you don’t mind I’d like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q and A section. Is that okay? Audience Member: Yes sure.</p>
<p>Mr Ford: Okay, so as I was saying we have an exciting campaign planned for the x420. Firstly, we will have a nationwide television campaign, as well as advertising on radio and also in many computer publications. We also intend to.</p>
<p>Audience Member: I’m sorry to stop you Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is cost effective. I mean, how much is that going to cost?</p>
<p>Mr Ford: Well I don’t have the figures to hand, but I’d be happy to discuss those figures with you after the presentation. Okay let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Tune Up (C0284)</p>
<p>A:	Welcome to Al’s Garage. What seems to be the problem?</p>
<p>B:	No problem at all! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.</p>
<p>A:	Very wise decision. When was the last time you had a tune up?</p>
<p>B:	Not that long ago, I think it was four months ago.</p>
<p>A:	We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers.</p>
<p>B:	Why? I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?</p>
<p>A:	First of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter. If you don’t do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.</p>
<p>B:	I see. What else?</p>
<p>A:	We also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid. We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.</p>
<p>B:	Ok, well, when you put it that way, it doesn’t seem like a waste of time and money.</p>
<p>A:	Trust me, regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Handyman (C0285)</p>
<p>A:	The air conditioning is not working! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here!</p>
<p>B:	Dan is on top of that. I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.</p>
<p>A:	That would be convenient. They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring. The circuit breakers keep going out all the time. It’s really annoying!</p>
<p>B:	Yeah you are right. This office is falling apart! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that’s why the parking lot was flooded.</p>
<p>A:	I know! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 6 ‐ Addressi ng the Audience (C0286)</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: The campaign that we have in store for the x420 is exciting, imaginative and revolutionary. We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: I would like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you we really could not have devised this campaign. I’d like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the</p>
<p>wonderful work you’ve done so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in your continuing your commitment to Alpha computers.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: There’s no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here and together we can really push Alpha computers to a whole new level of success.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: On the subject of the campaign let me ask you all a question. How do we define the perfect lap-top? Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability? What do you look for in a consumer? Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the x420 is a state-ofthe-art laptop for all of your computing needs. With our television campaign we hope to really reach out to a huge audience. Mr. Ford: We have a great ad campaign planned focusing on the fantastic USP’ s of the x420. We have hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign, and have already completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the x420.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: I’m excited to say that today, for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements!</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ High School Reunion (C0287)</p>
<p>A:	I hate coming to high school reunions.</p>
<p>B:	It will be great honey. We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they have been doing.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah I guess so. Oh look! There is Robert Matthews! Rob!</p>
<p>C:	Hey Bill! Wow great to see you!</p>
<p>A:	Likewise! It’s been a long time! This is my wife</p>
<p>Dorthy.</p>
<p>C:	Pleasure to meet you. So Bill, how have you been?</p>
<p>A:	Can’t complain! We have 2 children who are in college and my business is going well. What about you?</p>
<p>C:	Ah you know me! I am a dedicated bachelor. I never married although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary, you remember her? We were high school sweetheart, didn’t really work out between us, but I really can’t complain either.</p>
<p>A:	That’s good. Have you seen Frank? I was hoping he would come tonight.</p>
<p>C:	You didn’t hear? Frank passed away last year.</p>
<p>A:	Are you serious?</p>
<p>C:	Nah! I’m just yanking your chain. He’ll be here soon. I saw him just last week and he told me he would show up.</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ Getting A Tattoo (C0288)</p>
<p>A:	I have made up my mind. I am getting a tattoo.</p>
<p>B:	Really? Are you sure?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah but, it is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot!</p>
<p>A:	Really?</p>
<p>B:	Of course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.</p>
<p>A:	Oh, I didn’t know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something.</p>
<p>B:	I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, and that the place is hygienic.</p>
<p>A:	Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing!</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 7 ‐ Handling Technical Problems (C0289)</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Okay, so if we could dim the lights Jonathan, we can kick-off with the first TV advert. Please note that we are still in the early days with this advert, so it might seem a bit rough round the edges. Okay, so. just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the screen&hellip;</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Hmmmmmm. Sorry about this. Bear with me me a second. There seems to be a problem with the projector. Let me see. could you lend a hand a second? Jonathan: It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer. Let me check the connection a second&hellip; Well the connection seems okay, and the computer is running normally.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Okay. Sorry guys. Obviously a problem with the system. Let’s just reboot and start over. Let’s see if this resolves the issue.</p>
<p>Jonathan: Right, let’s try again. No, still nothing</p>
<p>Michael. There might be a technical issue with the projector. I think maybe the projector has overheated. We might need to cool it down for ten minutes and start again. I’ll call IT support to come over right now.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Okay guys. Unfortunately technical problems do crop up from time to time, don’t they? But it’s not a huge problem. In the meantime while the IT guys get to work on that I can talk a little bit more about the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with this campaign.</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ Buying Jewelery (C0290) Shop assistant: Good afternoon, sir, is there anything I can help you with today?</p>
<p>Mark: umm&hellip; yeah! I’m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend. Our fifth anniversary’s next Friday. Shop assistant: Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her. Is there anything particular that you have in mind?</p>
<p>Mark: No, not really&hellip; I’m completely at a loss.</p>
<p>Shop assistant: Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings, or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant. What is her favorite gemstone?</p>
<p>Mark: That purple one. I’m sorry&hellip;I’ve never bought jewelery for anyone and I’m kind of nervous.</p>
<p>Shop assistant: Don’t worry, we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment. That stone is an amethyst. We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces. Take</p>
<p>a	look at this bracelet. It’s 18K rose-gold, studded with amethyst and blue topaz. It’s a great statement piece.</p>
<p>Mark: Oh&hellip;wow. That’s really pretty. Jess would love that. But&hellip;I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?</p>
<p>Shop assistant: We have this beautiful platinum pendant, or you could also get her a locket. You could also get her a</p>
<p>timepiece—it’s both glamorous yet functional. If you</p>
<p>tell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help</p>
<p>you find something for her. Mark: Jess? Well, she’s very smart, and has a great sense of humor. She’s very feminine&hellip;</p>
<p>Shop assistant: Perhaps you could give her a ring?</p>
<p>Mark: Well&hellip;actually&hellip;I was thinking about asking</p>
<p>Jess to marry me&hellip;I’ve just been so nervous.</p>
<p>Shop	assistant:	Well	sir,	I	believe	your	fifth</p>
<p>anniversary is a great time to propose!</p>
<p>Mark: Okay, I’ve decided. I’m going to pop the question!</p>
<p>Shop assistant: Fabulous! We should look at engagement rings then! Now that’s a whole other section.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Ordering Chinese Food (C0291)</p>
<p>Waitress: Hi, welcome to Happy Buddah! Can I get</p>
<p>you anything to drink?</p>
<p>Manny: A Coke for me, please.</p>
<p>Andrea: I’ll have a Sprite.</p>
<p>Waitress: Okay, I’ll go get that for you. Are there any questions with the menu? Andrea: Do you use MSG?</p>
<p>Waitress: No ma’am, we are MSG-free.</p>
<p>Andrea: Oh man, I haven’t had Chinese food in so long! I want everything! This place has the BEST sesame chicken.</p>
<p>Manny: Yeah, I’ve been craving Chinese for such a long time. I used to get take-out all the time. It’s definitely been a while. Let’s start off with some crab rangoon.</p>
<p>Andrea: Ooh yeah, that sounds good. I think I’m going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.</p>
<p>Manny: It’s so tempting to order everything on the menu, it all looks so appetizing! I think I’ll get General Tso’s chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.</p>
<p>Andrea: Aren’t you supposed to be on a diet? You should at least get brown rice.</p>
<p>Manny: I don’t think so! I hate brown rice, and I’m so sick of eating healthy all the time. I’ve been eating so much salad I swear I’ve forgotten what meat tastes like! There’s no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorieladen Chinese food. I might even get an order of broccoli beef!</p>
<p>Andrea: Gosh, I’m so hungry! Let’s call the waitress over!</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 8 ‐ Common Presentation Mistakes (C0292)</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: So as I mentioned previously the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop: affordability, quality, speed and reliability. We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Actually, just to illustrate my point let me</p>
<p>give you an anecdote here. I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers. It was a lovely summer afternoon. Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf, and wanted to get his input on the new x420.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf. It really is a wonderful way to relax. To be honest, I’m not that great at golf, but I have improved in the last few years. But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice. I’ve lost my thread. What was I talking about again?</p>
<p>Jonathan: I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement Michael.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Yes, excuse me. I’m afraid I got sidetracked there. Yes anyway, the campaign. Well, erm. let me see. Is the projector working yet Jonathan?</p>
<p>Jonathan: No sorry, IT are still fixing it.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Ahh okay, erm&hellip; all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint. I haven’t actually got my notes with me&hellip;ermlet me see, erm&hellip;..</p>
<p>Audience Member: Mr. Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign? When are the first advertisements scheduled for?</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: That’s a good question. Unfortunately I erm&hellip;don’t have that information on me. I will have to get back to you on that point.</p>
<p>Jonathan: Okay Michael, the projector is fixed. I think we’re ready.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Thank goodness. Okay everyone, sorry for the delay. So without further ado the new x420 marketing campaign! Enjoy! oh ermmm. I’m terribly sorry, this is not the advert, this is my golfing holiday in Barbados. I think I must have brought the wrong file. Can we take five?</p>
<p>Advanced Media ‐ Cheese Lovers (F0293)</p>
<p>A:	Hello everyone my name is Laurie and I want to welcome you to this course. We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious foods on this planet; cheese! Let’s get started!</p>
<p>A:	Cheese is usually categorized intofour types: soft, semi- soft semi-hard and hard. The designation refers to the amount of moisture in the cheese, which directly affects its texture. Making cheese is an ancient practice, dating back thousands of years, and the home cheese maker can usually find recipes for cheese that falls into any of the four categories.</p>
<p>A:	Soft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie, bleu, roquefort, mozzarella, meunster and similar cheeses. These cheeses generally pair well with fruit or meats, or can be used as breakfast cheeses in an omelette Nor as pasta fillings. They are usually mildly flavored and very high in moisture.</p>
<p>A:	American, Colby, co-jack and similar cheeses are inthe semi-soft category. These are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a wide range of uses. Co-jack cheese, a blend of Colby and Monterrey jack is one of the most popular. This allows the sharper flavor of Colby to be combined with the milder jack cheese, and also melts better than plain Colby. Grilled cheese sandwiches often use American cheese, and Mexican cheeses such as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming more popular.</p>
<p>A:	Hard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere and others. Parmesan and Romano are most familiar as the grated powder used to top spaghetti, but they are also used as accompaniments for fruit, wine, nuts and other appetizer items. Swiss is a popular sandwich cheese and melts well, unlike some other hard cheeses.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Picking A University (C0294)</p>
<p>A:	I’ve never heard of AmLion College. Could you&hellip;</p>
<p>B:	Of course sir, let me give you a brief overview. AmLion College is located in the center of New York city. The school covers a wide range of academic subjects; and eighty percent of the courses are transferable to other state universities. And, last year AmLion College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.</p>
<p>A:	Interesting, and what about the tuition fees, then?</p>
<p>B:	You’ll be looking at somewhere around fifteen thousand US dollars per semester.</p>
<p>A:	Okay, well.</p>
<p>B:	And, did I mention our on-campus housing? Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as three thousand dollars per month!</p>
<p>A:	Sounds good. Well. I’ll just grab one of your flyers.</p>
<p>B:	Sir, you got the wrong flyer. Sir, sir!</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 9 ‐ Summar y and</p>
<p>Conclusion (C0295)</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Right everyone. I apologize that I can’t show you the marketing campaign today, but next week you will all have the opportunity to see if for yourselves, and I have no doubt that you will be impressed. Let me wrap up the presentation by summarising my key points.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 represents a key year for Alpha computers. The recession is hopefully behind us. It is clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming, especially in the developing markets.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: If we are to succeed in this ultracompetitive field then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs on all levels. As I hope I have illustrated, the x420 represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy those needs.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new x420 range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning. Once we establish the x420 in the market we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Alpha computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement. I really see no limit to our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier: quality, excellence and service.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Before we move on to the Q and A section I’d really like to leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we’ve discussed today, and hopefully it will provide you with the same inspiration that it gives me.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: As the great Henry Ford once said ” Quality means doing it right, when no one is looking” Well, in fact our customers are looking; they are looking for</p>
<p>us to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot. We cannot let them down!</p>
<p>Global View ‐ Vegan Or Vegetarian? (C0296)</p>
<p>A:	Hey Julie, you want to go grab something to eat?</p>
<p>B:	Sure! What do you feel like having?</p>
<p>A:	I really feel like having a big juicy steak!</p>
<p>B:	Oh. ok. I don’t eat meat, but that’s fine, I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>A:	I didn’t know you were a vegetarian!</p>
<p>B:	I’m not, I am a vegan.</p>
<p>A:	A what?</p>
<p>B:	A vegan. I don’t eat or use any animal based products. I don’t wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from an animal. I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don’t eat meat, but still have fish and seafood.</p>
<p>A:	Wow! That’s interesting! It must be tough!</p>
<p>B:	It’s a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it’s getting a bit less difficult.</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ Ordering At An Italian Restau rant (C0297)</p>
<p>A:	Good evening ladies. My name is Josh and I’ll be your server tonight. May I take your order?</p>
<p>B:	Do you have any recommendations?</p>
<p>A:	Well, I personally like the chicken penne with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine is also very nice.</p>
<p>B:	Hmm. I’d like to have the grilled chicken, but can</p>
<p>I have spaghetti instead of penne?</p>
<p>A:	Of course, mam. And for you?</p>
<p>C:	I&hellip; ah..I’ll have the horse tripe.</p>
<p>The Office ‐ Presentation Series 10 ‐ The Q a nd A</p>
<p>Session (C0298)</p>
<p>Jonathan: Well everyone, I’m sure you’d like to join me in thanking Michael for what was a really inspirational presentation. Sincere thanks</p>
<p>Michael. Jonathan: Now, I’m sure many of you will be keen to ask some questions, so I’d like to open it up a Q and A session. Please raise your hand if you have any questions at all. Janice, go ahead.</p>
<p>Janice: Yes thank you Jonathan. I would just like to go back to the comment Mr. Ford made in regards to our competitors, particularly Orange. Now as you know, Orange has established themselves as the market leader in the high-end lap-top market.</p>
<p>Janice: How does Mr. Ford expect to compete with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: Well Janice, first of all, thanks for a very</p>
<p>good question. I think you have hit the nail on the head actually. Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and power.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford: But, although we can’t compete in terms of size I do believe we hold an advantage in terms of dedication to customer service. Yes, I admit this is a David and Goliath battle,but don’t forget who won that contest.</p>
<p>Frank: Ermmm, Mr Ford. Could you elaborate on the actual technical details of the x420 a little more? Mr. Ford: I’d love to but I think we are a little pressed for time right now. However Jonathan has all the technical specs for you on the powerpoint presentation, which you can look over in your own time.</p>
<p>Marcie: Mr. Ford. One final question. Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Returning A Product (C0299)</p>
<p>A:	Hi I would like to return this TV.</p>
<p>B:	Sure, do you have the receipt?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah here you go. Actually I also want to return this keyboard.</p>
<p>B:	Ok, may I ask what is the reason for returning these products?</p>
<p>A:: The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.</p>
<p>B:	I see, and what about the keyboard?</p>
<p>A:	I spilled some coffee on it and now it won’t work.</p>
<p>B:	I am sorry sir, but we can only exchange or refund defective products, we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.</p>
<p>A:	Fine! I don’t know why they make these things so delicate anyways.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Online Dating (C0300)</p>
<p>A:	Do you want to hang out tomorrow?</p>
<p>B:	Oh, I can’t. I have a date!</p>
<p>A:	Really? Wow with who?</p>
<p>B:	This girl I’ve been chatting with forthe past couple of months. She’s really cool and she’s driving over here this weekend.</p>
<p>A:	Wait a minute, you mean you met her online?</p>
<p>B:	Yeah! I signed up for a website called match. and it is great! You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets. Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.</p>
<p>A:	That is kind of weird! What if she is a psycho or something like that?</p>
<p>B:	It’s the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends! I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.</p>
<p>A:	I guess it does seem logical. I’ll have to check it out!</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ Vampires (C0301)</p>
<p>A:	You want to go tothe movies tonight?</p>
<p>B:	Sure! What’s playing?</p>
<p>A:	The new Twilight movie!</p>
<p>B:	Twilight? As inthe vampire movies? No way I am watching that. I don’t understand why everyone isso excited about these films about vampires. It doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>A:	Of course it does. It’s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You have a couple that is in love but can’t be together because they are so different. Add in the fact that immortality and super human strengthis really sexy and there you have it! Plus the cast is hip, young people that make the movie even more enticing.</p>
<p>B:	I don’t buy into that. I think it’s just a fad. Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies!</p>
<p>Global View ‐ Phobias (C0302)</p>
<p>A:	Are you excited about your trip next month?</p>
<p>B:	Yes and no. I can’t wait to go to Europe, but at the same time I am terrified.</p>
<p>A:	Why?</p>
<p>B:	Well, I have aerophobia. I have a chronic fear of flying.</p>
<p>A:	Oh really? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying. It’s not that bad though, I mean, it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour. I actually have arachnophobia.</p>
<p>B:	You’re scared of spiders? I actually have two more phobias. Acrophobia and glossophobia.</p>
<p>A:	I guess that explains why you are afraid of flying, but public speaking is not that bad.</p>
<p>B:	Are you kidding? When I get on stage, my palms start to sweat, I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.</p>
<p>A:	Well, I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic. I</p>
<p>hate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds.</p>
<p>B:	We are such weirdos right?</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Mexican Food (C0303)</p>
<p>A:	Hello sir, welcome to Pistolera restaurant. May I take your order?</p>
<p>B:	Yes, I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.</p>
<p>A:	I’m sorry sir, but we ran out of chicken. May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.</p>
<p>B:	Sure I’ll have the burrito.. Do you have nachos?</p>
<p>A:	Of course sir. Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.</p>
<p>B:	Sounds good.</p>
<p>A:	Would you like anything to drink?</p>
<p>B:	Sure, I’ll have a Corona.</p>
<p>Daily Life ‐ Neat Freak (C0304)</p>
<p>A:	Ugg, this bathroom is a pigsty!</p>
<p>B:	Helen, why do you keep flushing the toilet? What’s wrong?</p>
<p>A:	I just can’t stand it. It’s really gross in here! There’s a stain on the toilet seat, and the floor was wet and slippery. So I cleaned it!</p>
<p>B:	You did what? Helen, I know it’s gross, but I’ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse. Why are you cleaning the counter top? are you out of your mind?</p>
<p>A:	I can’t help myself; it’s just so disgusting in here!</p>
<p>B:	Helen, this is not like your own bathroom. Just leave it to the cleaners,okay?</p>
<p>A:	Hang on. I’m just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.</p>
<p>B:	You’re such a neat freak! I’m outta here!</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ Bowling (C0305)</p>
<p>A:	Alright, so the first thing that you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that line where the lane begins.</p>
<p>B:	Why not?</p>
<p>A:	Because they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down. If you step there you will slip and fall.</p>
<p>A:	OK, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our names on the scorecard, so now, how the heck do I play this?</p>
<p>A:	You throw the ball down the lane and try to knock</p>
<p>down all the pins. If you do, that is called a strike. If you don’t knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare. After ten frames, we add up the points and see who has the most. Three hundred is a perfect score, but very hard to get.</p>
<p>B:	Got it! OK, I’m gonna give it a go. Oh no! My ball went in the gutter!</p>
<p>A:	I told you, its harder than you think. Now let a pro show you how it’s done.</p>
<p>The Weekend ‐ Pick Up Lines (C0306)</p>
<p>A:	Let’s got out tomorrow night. We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.</p>
<p>B:	I don’t think that’s a good idea. I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.</p>
<p>A:	Maybe you just need a few pick up lines,you know, break the ice.</p>
<p>B:	Pick up lines don’t work!</p>
<p>A:	Come on! You can just walk up to a girl and say:</p>
<p>“If you were a booger I’d pick you first.”</p>
<p>B:	What? Come on! That’s just lame! No girl would fall for that!</p>
<p>A:	Fine, then you can say: “So there you are! I’ve been looking all over for YOU, the woman of my dreams!”</p>
<p>B:	That’s a good one! I think that’s pretty funny.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink.</p>
<p>B:	Ok, how does this sound: “I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.”</p>
<p>A:	Nice! Let’s go!</p>

<p>James: Well, actually a little of both. I’m meeting some business contacts but I’m also taking some Mandarin classes too.</p>
<p>Michelle: That’s cool! How’s it going?</p>
<p>James: Well, I’m finding the classes pretty tough actually, but I’m having a great time in Shanghai. It’s really an amazing city.</p>
<p>Michelle: It sure is. Are you staying for long? James: Only two weeks unfortunately. I wish I could stay longer but.</p>
<p>Michelle: Well listen, if you need someone to show youthe sights then just call me. I’m having a little get together at my new apartment next week so if you want to drop bythen.</p>

<p>Global View ‐ Indian Food (C0309)</p>
<p>A:	So where is this mystery restaurant that we are going to?</p>
<p>B:	It’s an Indian restaurant! I know you have never had Indian food, so I thought you might want to try.</p>
<p>A:	That sounds great! I am craving some type of beef dish.</p>
<p>B:	Well, Indian cuisine actually doesn’t serve beef.</p>
<p>You see, cows are a sacred animal, a very important element inthe Hindu religion, so beef is not eaten.</p>
<p>A:	I see, so what are we having? Chicken?</p>
<p>B:	There are many amazing dishes to choose from. We can havesome chicken tikka masalawhich is an amazing curry. It’s a bit spicy, but I think you can handle it.</p>
<p>A:	Sounds good! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah. Also, we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven. Since you don’t use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop upthe curry or rice.</p>
<p>A:	What about veggies?</p>
<p>B:	They have a good variety of vegetable based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas or Daal.</p>
<p>A:	It all sounds exquisite! I can’t wait!</p>

<p>Michelle: That sounds really great. I love wine myself! Is this your first time to Shanghai Maria? Maria: No actually, I often visit. I usually come to China for business at least once a year. Also, I love the restaurants in Shanghai, so that’s a good reason to come.</p>
<p>Michelle: Me too. Actually, there’s a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend. I mean, the food is delicious butthe service isn’t so good. I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.</p>

<p>Tracy: Okay, more relaxed. Got it. . . . Hey Sally, what’s up? It’s Tracy here, just.</p>

<p>The Office ‐ First Paycheck (C0317)</p>
<p>Emily: Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck. Susan: You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair.</p>
<p>Emily: Well, this is my first paycheck here inthe States and there are a few things I don’t understand. First off, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan?</p>
<p>Susan: OK, let’s start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Emily: Yes, that’s easy enough to understand. Susan: Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It’s your federal income tax. And then there’s Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.</p>
<p>Emily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn’t actually a health insurance I can use now.</p>
<p>Susan: That’s right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There’s the state income tax, and then this SUI SDItax you were asking about</p>
<p>is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it’s a pretty small quantity that they take.</p>
<p>Emily: Yeah, I don’t mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes – one at a state level and one at a federal level?</p>
<p>Susan: That’s right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.</p>
<p>Emily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.</p>
<p>Susan: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody’s net pay is as high as they’d like. I can understand why you’d want some explanation.</p>
<p>Emily: Yeah, I guess it’s the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later!</p>

<p>Mindy: Graduate Management Admission Test, it contains three parts; Analytical Writing Assessment, the Quantitative section, and the Verbal section. Not only does the test mark you on the number of questions answered but also on the difficulty.</p>
<p>Ash: Okay this sounds a little tough, how am I supposed to practice for this?</p>
<p>Mindy: Up to you, you could have a one on one session with a tutor or group sessions, you can also use free or private computer software. Going to church might help as well!</p>
<p>Ash: No matter what I do I’m going to ace this test and go on to become a corporate fat cat!</p>
<p>Mindy: Umm.. . That’s the spirit!</p>

<p>A:	So what are you doing for Thanksgiving?</p>
<p>B:	Not much really. It’s more of an American tradition, so back home we don’t really celebrate it.</p>

<p>B:	What about here in physical education?</p>

<p>B:	Of course it does! They tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house. I think most of the times they are just scam artists.</p>
<p>A:	Well historically it is a practice that many cultures share. Reading the tarot cards, in the east they would even read tea leaves! I even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar, and then read your ashes.</p>

<p>A:	Ok, so can I say, “ This is Abby’s voicemail. I will call you later, so leave me your name and number”.</p>
<p>B:	That’s more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.</p>
<p>A:	Ok, so how about this, “ This is Abby and I am really happy you called! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number. Talk to you soon!”.</p>
<p>B:	A little too friendly Abby. Just say this, “ Hi, you have reached Abby. I am unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks”.</p>
<p>A:	That’s perfect! Can you say that again and record it for me?</p>

<p>B:	The heart!</p>

<p>B:	The stomach and intestines!</p>
<p>A:	Very good! Let’s not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste. Are we forgetting anything?</p>
<p>B:	Yeah! Our kidneys, liver and bladder!</p>

<p>in</p>
<p>their stockings, so I thought I’d be nice and make</p>
<p>Santa cookies. I even left out some milk. I heard someone in the kitchen eating the cookies, so I came downstairs!</p>
<p>A:	Hmm&hellip; well I know that Santa won’t come down the chimney with you hiding behind the tree, spying on him!</p>
<p>B:	Really?</p>

<p>Global View - The Night Before Christmas (C0337)</p>
<p>It was the night before Christmas, when all through the house</p>
<p>Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung bythe chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there; The children were nestled all snug in their beds, And mama in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap, Had just settled down for a long winter’s nap, When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.</p>
<p>Away to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.</p>
<p>The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below, When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer, With a little old driver, so lively and quick,</p>
<p>I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.</p>
<p>More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;</p>
<p>” Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and</p>
<p>Vixen!</p>
<p>On, Comet! on Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!</p>
<p>As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too. And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof.</p>
<p>The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;</p>
<p>A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,</p>
<p>And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes – how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!</p>
<p>His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, Andthe beard of his chin was as white as the snow; The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, Andthe smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; He had a broad face and a little round belly,</p>
<p>That shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,</p>
<p>Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;</p>
<p>He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled allthe thestockings; then turned with a jerk,</p>
<p>And laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, upthe chimney he rose;</p>
<p>He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,</p>
<p>” Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.</p>
<p>Daily Life - Having Leftovers (C0338)</p>
<p>A:	What’s for dinner?</p>
<p>B:	Leftovers.</p>
<p>A:	What? Leftovers of what and from when?</p>
<p>B:	From last night! I took the left over turkey, mixed it with some diced peppers and onions, added a little bit of mayonnaise and made some sandwiches!</p>
<p>A:	Isn’t that dangerous though? I mean bacteria and germs reproducing on food that was left out or reheated?</p>
<p>B:	Well, I didn’t leave the turkey out at room temperature for more than an hour and I refrigerated it soon after we finished eating. Also, when reheating,</p>
<p>I put it in the oven for fifteen minutes at one hundred degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>A:	Well ok, I am just afraid of getting food poisoning.</p>
<p>B:	Don’t worry about it! Making a new meal out of leftovers is almost an art! Not only do you save money, but you also get to be creative and have something different to eat!</p>
<p>Global View - Parent Teacher Conference (C0339)</p>
<p>A:	Thank you for coming tonight Mrs. Webber. As a teacher, it’s great seeing the kid’s parents assist our parent-teacher conference night.</p>
<p>B:	Of course! I am very interested to know how my child is doing and also get some insight from you as to how he can improve.</p>
<p>A:	Well Allen is a great student. He is a hard worker and very well behaved, however he does struggle a bit with math.</p>
<p>B:	I guess he gets that from me, I never did well in math when I was a kid. What can I do at home to compliment what he is learning in the classroom.</p>
<p>A:	Well, it’s important that you sit with him and review his homework assignments and help him with math. I would also recommend he stay after school twice a week for tutoring sessions. It will really help a lot.</p>
<p>B:	Thanks a lot! I will definitely do that. Is there anything else?</p>
<p>A:	Um.. yes. Here is a notice from our financial department, seems your child’s tution is overdue.</p>

<p>A:: fresh start to accomplish any dreams, objectives and goals.</p>
<p>A:	Do you have a New Year’s resolution?</p>
<p>B:	I was thinking about it, but I’m never able to keep my New Year’s resolution. Last year for example I joined a gym and only went twice.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah I know what you mean. That’s why this year</p>
<p>I am keeping things more simple. Maybe like getting together with friends I haven’t seen in a long time, or doing some volunteering work.</p>
<p>B:	That seems reasonable. We should get together and watch the ball drop in Times Square.</p>
<p>A:	Sure, as long as you don’t try to kiss me at midnight!</p>
<p>B:	Well, we can’t break tradition! It’s bad luck!</p>
<p>Daily Life - Baking A Cake (C0341)</p>
<p>A:	Ok, so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake?</p>
<p>B:	Almost, let me just put my apron on.</p>
<p>A:	Ok, so the first thing we are going to do is preheat the oven, that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything. Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>B:	Got it.</p>
<p>A:	No we are gonna make the batter. Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency. Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.</p>
<p>B:	Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer?</p>
<p>A:	Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed. I’m gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.</p>
<p>B:	Ok, so now we need a baking pan right?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the cake won’t stick to it when it bakes.</p>
<p>B:	Done. So how long do we bake it for?</p>
<p>A:	We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes.</p>
<p>Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.</p>
<p>B:	Wow! This was a lot easier than I thought!</p>

<p>B:	Yes I am. You can check our online catalog to search the book you want based on the genre, title or if you know the author, I can point you towards the right direction.</p>
<p>A:	I am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes.</p>
<p>B:	That would be in our children’s section. That book shelf there on the right.</p>
<p>A:	Ok, I would like to check out these books.</p>
<p>B:	Do you have a library card?</p>
<p>A:	No. How do I get one?</p>
<p>B:	I just need to see your drivers license or utility bill to prove that you a resident of this state.</p>
<p>A:	Here you go.</p>
<p>B:	So you are all set. You can have these books for two weeks. If you need to have them longer, you can bring them here to renew them. If you don’t, you get charged ten cents a day for each book.</p>

<p>B:	I can’t, I have to go tothe gym.</p>
<p>A:	Come on! You can go tomorrow, just skip it today.</p>
<p>It’s not as if you are gonna get in trouble!</p>
<p>B:	Actually I will! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don’t go. I like it, because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.</p>
<p>A:	That’s cool, does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?</p>
<p>B:	Yeah. He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on, or the muscles I want to build. Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights. Then for my quads, calves and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.</p>
<p>A:	Sounds like you are really getting in shape!</p>
<p>Global View - All About Wines (C0346) Salesperson: Hello there, welcome to WineWorld. Let me know if I can help you out at all.</p>
<p>Customer: Um, yes, please, I could really use some help. I’m going over to my boss’ house for dinner tonight and don’t know what kind of wine I should bring.</p>
<p>Salesperson: OK, do you know what kind of food will be served?</p>
<p>Customer: Well, his wife is Japanese. He said she makes really good sushi.</p>
<p>Salesperson: Hmm, that’s a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.</p>
<p>Well, let’s see. have to be a white wine, of course. Customer: Why? Wouldn’t a red wine go well with sushi?</p>
<p>Salesperson: No, I don’t think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish. Customer: I see. So should I get a bottle of</p>
<p>Chardonnay? That’s a white wine, right?</p>
<p>Salesperson: Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but</p>
<p>I’m not sure it’d be your best bet.</p>
<p>Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I’d suggest that you go for something</p>
<p>brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.</p>
<p>Customer: Sauvignon Blanc? What’s that?</p>
<p>Salesperson: That’s another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.</p>
<p>Customer: Let’s see. The label says it’s</p>
<p>got ”attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a bonedry finish. Serve chilled.” Oh, no, how long will it take to chill the wine? I’m on my way to the dinner now.</p>
<p>Salesperson: It’s OK, don’t worry, we’ll just choose a wine from the cooler. We don’t have quite as extensive a selection over here,</p>
<p>but&hellip;this Rhone Valley white would be lovely. Customer: All right. What varietal is that? Salesperson: Well, this is a French wine, so they don’t always specify the varietal on the label.</p>
<p>The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine.</p>
<p>This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier,</p>
<p>I’d guess.</p>
<p>Customer: And you think this is a good wine? Salesperson: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It’s not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it’s more approachable. It’s light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.</p>
<p>Customer: Perfect! I’ll take it!</p>
<p>Global View - Immigration and Customs (C0347)</p>
<p>A:	Good afternoon, passport and arrival card please.</p>
<p>B:	Here you are.</p>
<p>A:	Where are you coming from?</p>
<p>B:	China.</p>
<p>A:	Is this your country of birth or residence.</p>
<p>B:	I just work there.</p>
<p>A:	What is the purpose of your visit to the United States?</p>
<p>B:	I’m here on vacation.</p>
<p>A:	How long do you plan to stay in the United States?</p>
<p>B:	Almost three weeks.</p>
<p>A:	Sir, you didn’t fill out the information on your arrival card of where you will be staying.</p>
<p>B:	Oh, I’m sorry, but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United States, so I wasn’t sure what to put.</p>
<p>A:	You must specify an address of the place where you will spend most of your time.</p>
<p>B:	Ok, here you are.</p>
<p>A:	Do you have enough means to support yourself while you are here?</p>
<p>B:	Yes. I have some travellers cheques and two credit cards.</p>
<p>A:	Very good. Do you have anything to declare?</p>
<p>B:	Nope. I only have my clothes and camera!</p>
<p>A:	Very well sir, welcome to the United States, enjoy your visit.</p>
<p>The Weekend - Talking About Skincare (C0348)</p>
<p>A:	You want to go get a facial with me today?</p>
<p>B:	Dude, what are you talking about? Only girls do that.</p>
<p>A:	Not at all, guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures. There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.</p>
<p>B:	True. So what do they do to you at your beauty spa?</p>
<p>A:	Well, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin. Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young. Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.</p>
<p>B:	That doesn’t really sound like something I would be interested in. In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.</p>
<p>A:	Well you should come with me one day, I’m sure you’ll love it.</p>
<p>B:	Uh&hellip; no.</p>
<p>Global View - Chinese Medicine (C0349)</p>
<p>A:	What’s wrong?</p>
<p>B:	I have a headache. These past few days I’ve been living off painkillers. Man, I feel like my head is going to explode.</p>
<p>A:	You should get acupuncture treatment. My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her.</p>
<p>B:	The results are too slow. On top of that, just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me.</p>
<p>A:	They don’t just randomly stick you, they find your pressure points. The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment, restoring the body’s ”chi”.</p>
<p>B:	But I get scared the moment I see a needle. How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end?</p>
<p>A:	The needles are very thin, and as long as the doctor’s technique is good, and the patient himself is relaxed, it won’t hurt–on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain. Now there are high-tech</p>
<p>needles that are micro thin; they don’t hurt at all.</p>
<p>However, if you are really scared of acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also options.</p>
<p>B:	Scraping is too terrifying. When they finish</p>
<p>scrapping, your body is all red, as if you were just tortured.</p>
<p>Cupping is the same, your body ends up with red circles all over it–looks like someone beat you up.</p>
<p>A:	This only signifies that the toxins have left the body. Actually, there is only discomfort during the treatment process. Once it’s over you feel very comfortable.</p>
<p>B:	Chinese medicine is strange. The patients are already</p>
<p>ill, and then the doctor makes them suffer more.</p>
<p>A:	This is the only way to get at the problem. Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain, You are just going to have to be tough and do it.</p>
<p>B:	Forget it. I don’t want to inflict any more pain on myself. In a little while I’ll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.</p>
<p>Daily Life - Talking About Relatives (C0350)</p>
<p>A:	What are you doing this weekend?</p>
<p>B:	My brother in law is having a small get together at his house and he invited me.</p>
<p>A:	Is it a family thing or just friends?</p>
<p>B:	A bit of both. Some cousins, aunts and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.</p>
<p>A:	Is your great uncle Rick going to be there? He is really funny.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife.</p>
<p>A:	You mean your sister?</p>
<p>B:	No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he is my grandmother’s brother.</p>
<p>A:	You lost me.</p>
<p>B:	I’ll explain later, let’s go.</p>
<p>Daily Life - Vaccinations (C0351)</p>
<p>A:	Hello Mrs. Parker, how have you been?</p>
<p>B:	Hello Dr. Peters. Just fine thank you. Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.</p>
<p>A:	Very well. Let’s see, according to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his Polio, Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots. He is 14 months old, so he is due for Hepatitis A, Chickenpox and Measles shots.</p>
<p>B:	What about Rubella and Mumps?</p>
<p>A:	Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest.</p>
<p>B:	Ok great. Doctor, I think I also may need a Tetanus booster. Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago!</p>
<p>A:	We will check our records and I’ll have the nurse administer the booster as well. Now, please hold</p>
<p>Ricky’s arm tight, this may sting a little.</p>
<p>Global View - The 7 Wonders Of The World (C0352)</p>
<p>A:	Have you seen this news article? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online.</p>
<p>B:	Wow, that’s really interesting. So who won?</p>
<p>A:	Well, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.</p>
<p>B:	I’ve been there! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art. The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds!</p>
<p>A:	Cool! Also amongst the winners is Petra, in Jordan,</p>
<p>Machu Picchu in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico.</p>
<p>B:	Wait a minute! It also says that the Christ</p>
<p>Redeemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders. I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum, stand in the middle like a gladiator!</p>
<p>A:	Well, let’s see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>B:	Good idea!</p>
<p>Global View - College Life (C0353)</p>
<p>A:	Hey, Jordan, is that you? Long time no see!</p>
<p>B:	Oh, hey, no kidding! I haven’t seen you since orientation three months ago! So how’ve you been?</p>
<p>Settling into college life OK?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, I think so! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I’m living at the frat house now.</p>
<p>B:	Oh, so you’re a frat boy now, huh?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, yeah, I know, it’s totally clich ´ e, but really, I think it’s been a good decision. I’ve got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you been up to?</p>
<p>B:	Not much. I’m still living at home and commuting to school. I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about. It just wasn’t as interesting as I’d hoped. The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.</p>
<p>A:	That sounds smart. . . but kind of boring.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah, it is, a little bit. I joined the Great Outdoors</p>
<p>Club, though, which has been a lot of fun. We’ve gone on two camping trips already, and I’ve made some good friends.</p>
<p>A:	That’s cool. Hey, so have you decided on your</p>
<p>major yet?</p>
<p>B: Definitely pre-med. What about you?</p>
<p>A:	I still have no clue. . . but we don’t have to declare a major ‘til our sophomore year, so I’ve got time! Oops, I’m late for class. Gotta run!</p>
<p>B:	OK, take care! Hey, nice running into you!</p>
<p>A: Yeah, you too!</p>
<p>Global View - Homeschooling (C0354)</p>
<p>A:	I think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids.</p>
<p>B:	What? Why?</p>
<p>A:	Well, our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive. I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages.</p>
<p>B:	Like what? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction.</p>
<p>A:	Well, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way. I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses.</p>
<p>B:	I think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.</p>
<p>A:	I will bring it up over Sunday brunch.</p>
<p>B:	Good luck with that!</p>
<p>Daily Life - Lending Money (C0355)</p>
<p>A:	Can I borrow five bucks?</p>
<p>B:	No!</p>
<p>A:	Come on! I’ll pay you back on Tuesday.</p>
<p>B:	Last time I lent you money, you never paid me back.</p>
<p>A:	I promise if you lend me five dollars today, I will repay you in full next week.</p>
<p>B:	Ok, but I’m taking your skateboard as collateral.</p>
<p>A:	Fine! I can’t believe you don’t trust me.</p>
<p>B:	It’s nothing personal, just business.</p>
<p>Daily Life - Coins and Money (C0356)</p>
<p>A:	Help me organize these coins.</p>
<p>B:	That’s a lot of money! What did you do? Break the piggy bank?</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, I’m gonna go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles.</p>
<p>B:	Ok, I’ll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.</p>
<p>A:	Great, then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.</p>
<p>B:	I found some coins that are not from here.</p>
<p>A:	Oh yeah, those are from my trip to London. I have</p>
<p>a couple of different pence, but in all it won’t add up to one pound.</p>
<p>B:	Are you sure the bank will change these coins for you?</p>
<p>A:	Hopefully!</p>
<p>Daily Life - Making A Dinner Reservation (C0357)</p>
<p>A:	Bruno Bistro, how may I help you?</p>
<p>B:	Yes hello, I would like to make a reservation please.</p>
<p>A:	Certainly sir, For which day and time please?</p>
<p>B:	Tonight at seven.</p>
<p>A:	I’m sorry sir, but we are fully booked tonight until eight.</p>
<p>B:	In that case, eight o’clock is fine.</p>
<p>A:	Very well, and how many people will attend tonight?</p>
<p>B:	Four people.</p>
<p>A:	Lastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?</p>
<p>A:	Mark.</p>
<p>Daily Life - Text Me (C0358)</p>
<p>A:	Why didn’t you text me last night?</p>
<p>B:	What? I sent you three or four messages!</p>
<p>A:	I didn’t get any of them. I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message.</p>
<p>B:	Why didn’t you just call? I hate sending SMS messages.</p>
<p>A:	Well, because I didn’t have any credit on my phone. I used it all up this month.</p>
<p>B:	I thought you had an unlimited SMS plan?</p>
<p>A:	I do, but if I don’t have any credit in my phone, it won’t let me call or send messages.</p>
<p>B:	No wonder you didn’t get my texts!</p>
<p>Global View - E-mail Scam (C0359)</p>
<p>A:	I got an urgent email from Tom! He says he is in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.</p>
<p>B:	What? That sounds really dodgy tome.</p>
<p>A:	No way, Tom is an honest person, he wouldn’t lie tome.</p>
<p>B:	No I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out. I mean think about it, why would he email you instead of calling you.</p>
<p>A:	Do you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?</p>
<p>B:	For sure! There are so many con artists out there, you never really know.</p>
<p>Global View - Urban Legends (C0360)</p>
<p>A:	Have you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?</p>
<p>B:	What do you mean?</p>
<p>A:	I was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed! Then they are sold on the black market.</p>
<p>B:	Don’t tell me you actually believe all that? Don’t be so gullible, they are just urban legends. They are just stories people make up to scare you.</p>
<p>A:	Well, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards! Can you believe that?</p>
<p>B:	You really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song? Don’t be so naive!</p>
<p>A:	Well maybe you are right, but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster!</p>
<p>B:	Sounds a bit too far fetched to be true don’t you think?</p>
<p>Daily Life - Fast Food (C0361)</p>
<p>A:	I’m hungry, let’s order up something to eat.</p>
<p>B:	Ok, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.</p>
<p>A:	I was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries and a chocolate sundae.</p>
<p>B:	You eat too much junk food. That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.</p>
<p>A:	Well I never seem to gain weight so I don’t mind.</p>
<p>B:	It’s not only about getting fat or not, it’s about being healthy. You could really have some health problems later on.</p>
<p>A:	How about pizza or maybe some fried chicken!</p>
<p>Better yet, let’s order some hot dogs!</p>
<p>B:	You are a lost cause.</p>
<p>Daily Life - What Mood Are You In? (C0362)</p>
<p>A:	Are you ok? You seem a bit anxious.</p>
<p>B:	Yeah I’m OK, I have been having a lot of mood swings lately. I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.</p>
<p>A:	So you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?</p>
<p>B:	Yeah, it’s weird. For example just this morning</p>
<p>I was feeling detached and lonely, even though there was really no reason to feel that way.</p>
<p>A:	Well, maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave and hopeful!</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>B: I hope you are right.</p>
<p>Daily Life - Living With Your Parents (C0363)</p>
<p>A:	Why did your girlfriend break up with you?</p>
<p>B:	I don’t know, she said she was tired of me not manning up and being more independent, which I think is all a bunch of crap.</p>
<p>A:	Well, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.</p>
<p>B:	What do you mean? Lots of people live with their parents, especially when rent is so expensive and the slump in the economy.</p>
<p>A:	Yeah, but you are almost forty! Plus, you make good money so there is really no excuse. It’s simply because you are a momma’s boy.</p>
<p>B:	Whatever dude, I have everything I need, why would I move out! Have a great roof over my head, my mom does my laundry and cooks for me, what else could a guy ask for!</p>
<p>A:	Let’s agree to disagree.</p>
<p>Daily Life - Hiring Help (C0364)</p>
<p>A:	Can you help me write a newspaper ad?</p>
<p>B:	Sure, what are you looking to buy or sell?</p>
<p>A:	Actually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.</p>
<p>B:	Oh, you want to get a maid?</p>
<p>A:	Well, I think it’s better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic help.</p>
<p>B:	Ok, so what do you want her to do?</p>
<p>A:	Well, let’s see. I want her to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom and maybe do some cooking.</p>
<p>B:	Got it. And how much do you offer per month?</p>
<p>A:	I would pay her hourly, I don’t know what the going rate is though.</p>
<p>B:	I know for sure it’s more than minimum wage but maybe you should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.</p>
<p>A:	Great! Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>Daily Life - Household Chores (C0365)</p>
<p>A:	Kevin, what is this mess? It looks like a pigsty in here! Clean this up!</p>
<p>B:	Ok dad, I will do it in a minute, let me just finish this level of this game.</p>
<p>A:	No, I said now! Plus, you are grounded, you’re not allowed to play video games. I want you to make your bed, do the laundry and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.</p>
<p>B:	That’s so unfair!</p>
<p>A:	You have to pull your weight around here young man. My house, my rules.</p>
<p>B:	But I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture and vacuumed the rugs!</p>
<p>A:	That’s great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.</p>

We’re there to show the government that we don’t like the way that they’re spending our tax dollars!\nA:\tSir but what exactly is making everyone so angry?\nB:\tIt’s an absolute outrage, Sarah, the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers’ money to the auto industry.

This is a chance for me to get a jump start on building my nest egg.\nB:\tI don’t know about that; with all the uncertainty in the markets right now, it would be a very unwise decision to invest. I don’t know if you’re aware son, but there has been a lot of turmoil in the markets recently. There have already been half a million layoffs in the last few months, and we have no idea how the proposed stimulus package will impact the economy. There’s just too much instability. I wouldn’t feel comfortable investing in this climate.\nA:\tBut look at it this way, every challenge is an opportunity. And anyway, I’m not talking about investing in the domestic market. There are emerging markets that promise great returns. Look at China, for example; they have 1.4 billion people, half a billion of whom have recently entered the middle class. Here alone, the aggregate demand for consumer goods rePresents an amazing wealth generating opportunity.\nB:\tCome on, son, you’re looking at this too naively, the Chinese market has exhibited a great deal of instability, and their currency has been devalued by\nalmost a whole percentage point.\nA:\tFine, then!

As I’m sure you’re all aware, with the credit crunch, and the global financial crisis, we’re obligated to look for more cost efficient ways of producing our goods. We don’t want to have to be looking at redundancies. So, we’ve outlined a brief plan to implement the just-in-time philosophy.\nB:\tWe have two basic points that we want to focus on. First of all, we want to reduce our lead time.\nC:\tWhy would want to do that? I think this is not an area that really needs to be worked on.\nB:\tWell, we want to reduce production and delivery lead timesfor better overall efficiency.\nA:\tRight, production lead times can be reduced by moving work stations closer together, reducing queue length, like for example, reducing the number of jobs waiting to be processed at a given machine, and improving the coordination and cooperation between successive processes. Delivery lead times can be reduced through close cooperation with suppliers, possibly by inducing suppliers to locate closer to the factory or working with a faster shipping company.\nC:\tI see\u0026amp; That makes sense.\nB:\tThe second point is that we want to require supplier quality assurance and implement a zero defects quality program. We currently have far too many errors that lead to defective items and therefore, they must be eliminated. A quality control at the source program must be implemented to give workers the personal responsibility for the quality of the work they do, and the authority to stop production when something goes wrong.\nC:\tI’m with you on this one. It’s essential that we reduce these errors; we’ve got to force our suppliers to reduce their mistakes.\nA:\tExactly. Well, let’s look at how we’re going to put this plan into action. First\u0026hellip;(fade out)\nElementary ‐ Intermediate ‐ Carnival in Rio! (C0048) A:\tI can’t believe we’re here!

Please take a seat.\nB:\tThank you.\nA:\tSo, let’s get started; tell me a bit about your educational background.\nB:\tSure! Well, I graduated with honors from Chesterton University with a major in Business Administration, with a specialization in Information Management, and I minored in psychology. I chose\nthis course of study for two reasons: I wanted to gain some practical, marketable skills, which the information management track provided, and I also feel that interpersonal skills are essential for professional success, hence the minor in psychology.\nA:\tInteresting. And, your postgraduate studies?\nB:\tWell, I am really passionate about consumer behavior, so I pursued a master’s in that area. I also strive to keep my professional skills current, so I continuously attend seminars and conferences related management and customer service.\nA:\tVery good. Now, tell me a little bit about your work experience. I see here that you previously worked at Oracle.\nB:\tYeah, I worked as their customer support manager, which brought me a breadth of experience in both client care, and process management. I supervised and coordinated the customer support team as well as implemented new strategies to achieve better customer satisfaction.\nA:\tInteresting\u0026hellip;\nB:\tYes, in this position I was able to make some pretty significant contributions to the overall success of the company.

Now, I have a couple of final questions.\nB:\tI hope they’re not too hard!\nA:\tWell, why should we hire you?\nB:\tI think that I would be a perfect fit in this company. I have a unique combination of strong technical acumen, and outstanding soft skills; you know, I excel at building strong, long-term customer relationships. For example, when I headed the customer support department in my previous company, our team solved about seventy percent of our customers’ problems. I decided that we needed better information and technical preparation on our products, so after I implemented a series of training sessions in coordination with our technical department, we were able to solve ninety percent of our customers’ issues. Given the opportunity, I could bring this kind of success to this company.\nA:\tImpressive! So, what would you consider to be your greatest weakness?\nB:\tTo be honest, I struggle with organization and time management. Punctuality has never been a strength of mine. I find it hard to organize my time\nefficiently. I have actually addressed this weakness recently, by attending a workshop on efficient time management. It helped me a lot, by providing me with great insights on how to get organized and use my time efficiently, so I think I’m getting better now.\nA:\tGreat\u0026hellip; Well, let me tell you that I am very pleased with this interview.

Let’s get started. As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system.

No, May first is\nInternational Workers’ Day.\nB:\tDo we get a day off from school then?\nA:\tNo! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US, but in other countries it is.\nB:\tAww, man!\nA:\tIn the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of\nmany union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day’s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect.\nB:\tCool! Is that why we only work eight hours now?\nA:\tYes! But the happy ending came at a high price. On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality.\nB:\tAnd then what happened?\nA:\tWell, as we say, the rest is history\u0026hellip;\nElementary\t‐\tThe Weekend‐\tFunky Galaxy Battles (C0079) A:\tThey are breaking through!

But what are the payment terms?\nB:\tFirst and last month rent as deposit and rent is due on the 1st of every month.

I am taking an intercontinental flight!\nI’m flying sixteen thousand kms! How am I supposed to only take two, twenty kilo bags? That’s absurd!\nA:\tI am sorry, sir, there’s nothing I can do. You cannot board the flight with that large bag either. Carry-on bags must fit in the over-head compartment or under your seat. That bag is clearly too big.\nB:\tNow I see. You charge next to nothing for an international ticket, but when it comes to charging for any other small thing, you charge an arm and a leg! So tell me, miss, how much will I have to pay for all of this.\nA:\tLet’s see\u0026hellip; six hundred and twenty-five US dollars.\nB:\tThat’s more than my round-trip ticket!\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ I’m Sorry I Love Yo u VIII (C0090) A:\tVeronica!

What are you doing here?\nA:\tWhen I was a young boy, I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad. It was a peaceful town, and my father was a renowned chemist. One day, he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry. I never saw him again. I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau.\nB:\tWhat does that have to do with those men shooting at us? Most importantly, why did you lie to me!\nA:\tI’m sorry, I wasn’t supposed to meet you.

We’ve got a very exciting encounter ahead of us today as two powerhouse teams, Brazil and China, face off against each other and try to qualify for the next round. Without a doubt, both teams are in top shape and this will prove to be a competitive match.\nA:\tThe ref signals the start of the game and here we go.

The Brazilian blockers anticipated the play and tried to block him but he managed to get the ball in! Great play.\nA:\tIt’s China’s service now. What a superb jump serve by Li, oh, and we have a let serve. The ball was coming in fast and almost made it over the net.\nB:\tBrazil calls for a time out and we’ll be right back, after a short commercial break.\nElementary ‐ Global View ‐ Big Bang Theory (C0094) A:\tWhat’s up? You don’t look too good.\nB:\tYeah, my head hurts, that’s all. I’ve been in physics class all day. It’s killer!\nA:\tI liked physics. It’s all math, really; arcs, curves, velocity, cool stuff.\nB:\tYeah, yeah, but today’s lesson was all about the creation of the universe.\nA:\tA physics class about the creation of the universe?\nThat’s some pretty unscientific language there.\nSounds more religious to me.\nB:\tIt’s all religion. Take the theory of the Big Bang. How is it possible that all of the stuff in the universe comes from an explosion? That’s no better than Atlas carrying the globe on his back or African myths about turtles and stuff.\nA:\tTurtles? Whatever\u0026hellip; Look, all that’s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles. At least, that’s what the math says.\nB:\tMath, shmath. What’s the evidence?\nA:\tThere is evidence! You know Edwin Hubble? He’s the guy who in the early twentieth century was the first scientist to measure the drift of matter in the universe, thus advancing notions of an expanding universe. What would it be expanding from? Well, the Big Bang\u0026hellip; DUH!\nB:\tAnyway, it’s just a theory. Why do people go around touting theories? Where’s the scientific rigor in that?\nA:\tDude, don’t equivocate. A theory only becomes a theory after withstanding rigorous testing. You slept through class, didn’t you?\nB:\tAgh! You’re making my head hurt again! Quit with the questions!\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Talking About a Past Event (C0095) A:\tMike! Hey, how are you, man! Long time no see!\nB:\tHey, Pat!

Now, if we move down to the south of the state, we can see that a cold front is moving in.

My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson.\nB:\tThank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about\nthe movie ” Lion King”. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?\nA:\tWell, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man’s eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it’s a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.\nB:\tI think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.\nA:\tPredictable! How! Come on Dick, It’s a G-rated movie! It’s for the kids! It’s not a thriller!\nB:\tWell, that’s just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasa dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasa dies, Simba runs away thinking it’s his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It’s just too cliché.\nA:\tHow can it be cliché? It’s a fable! It’s telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.\nB:\tYou have always been so soft, Dave!\nA:\tOpen your heart Dick. Don’t shut us out.\nB:\tAnyway\u0026hellip; That’s all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk about \u0026quot;How to lose a guy in 10 days\u0026quot; I’m sure you’ll love that one Dave!\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Where are you fro m?

You don’t look very Chinese to me, if you don’t mind me saying so.\nB:\tIt’s fine. I am actually from Mexico. I was in China on a business trip, visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products.\nA:\tWow sounds interesting! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but, how old are you?\nB:\tDon’t you know it’s rude to ask a lady her age?\nA:\tDon’t get me wrong! It’s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas!\nB:\tWell thank you! In that case, I am 26 years old,\nand what about yourself?\nA:\tI am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U.S of A, although I have some Colombian heritage.\nB:\tReally? That’s great! Do you speak some Spanish?\nA:\tUh\u0026hellip; yeah.. of course!\nB:\tQue bien! Entonces podemos hablar en espanol!\nElementary ‐ The Weekend ‐ 1970’s (C0101) A:\tHey man!

Well, Jim went to the rink with Sherry and he said it was dy-no-mite! He was low on bread, but Sherry paid for everything.\nB:\tGravy! Jim is such a jive turkey man. He is always hitting me up for cash. Anyway, you wanna book and go grab some grub?\nA:\tYeah man, I’m starving!\nElementary ‐ Global View ‐ Global Warming (C0102) A:\tAnd therefore, global warming is the greatest deception of the early 21st century. Questions?\nB:\tUh\u0026amp; yeah. In the lecture you said theres more evidence in the scientific record supporting global cooling?\nA:\tWell, yes, essentially, the historical record supports a theory of climate cycles. Warming and cooling are cooperating processes in the planetary eco-system.\nB:\tIf thats true and the planet is getting cooler, what explains the rapid melting of the polar ice caps and the dramatic rise in the global average temperatures?\nA:\tBut are global temperatures rising? If you look at the data from nineteen seventy-five youll\u0026amp;\nB:\tYoull be misled. If you were serious, you would look at the record starting in the 1880s. Then you would see how dramatically the earths temperature has changed.\nA:\tYoung lady, I beg to differ. Look, the point of the lecture was to emphasize that there is evidence for\nboth sides, and I’m putting forth the argument that there’s greater evidence in support of the global cooling hypothesis. Look, it’s an indisputable fact that the public is being manipulated and scared into believing theres some kind of climate crisis; this scaremongering is done, quite simply, for political reasons.\nB:\tBut even without the uncomfortable reality that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide contribute to global warming, isnt the topic appropriate for politicians to discuss?\nA:\tNot if they want to use your tax dollars and mine to fund completely unnecessary initiatives.\nB:\tYeah, like conservation, protecting endangered species and investing in renewable energy. At the very least, you have to concede that this debate has the potential to end our dependence on foreign oil. Buying oil supports autocratic countries that use these revenues to devastating ends.\nA:\tWhy, Ive never been so disrespected in all of my days. I’m a professor, a scientist and researcher of high regard.\nB:\tYeah, and a duplicitous one at that. Everyone knows youre in the pocket of the oil lobby. Why should we trust your so-called findings more than tobacco institute studies which say smoking doesnt harm health? Youre full of it.\nA:\tSome people just cannot handle civil debate!\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Baby, I’m Sorry (C0 103) A:\tCan we talk?\nB:\tSure, honey, we’re talking now, aren’t we?\nA:\tYou know what I mean.\nB:\tYeah.

Well, I guess that’s my answer, isn’t it.\nB:\tHoney\u0026hellip;\nA:\tLook, if you don’t love me, it’s not a thing, alright, we’ve had our laughs, but I don’t appreciate\u0026hellip;\nmaybe it’s just time we\u0026hellip;\nB:\tBaby, I love you so much.\nA:\tYou do?\nB:\tI love you.

The foie gras for the lady, and a mushroom soup for you.\nA:\tWaiter, I ordered a cream of mushroom soup with asparagus. This soup is obviously too runny, and it’s over-seasoned. It’s completely inedible!\nB:\tOkay, I do apologize for that. Can I bring you another soup, or would you like to order something else?\nA:\tTake this foie gras back as well, it’s rubbery and completely overcooked. And look at the portion size! How can you charge twenty-five dollars for a sliver of duck liver?\nB:\tRight away\u0026hellip; sir.\nC:\tHoney come on! The foie gras was fine, why are you making such a big deal? Are you trying to get our meal comped again?\nA:\tWhat do you mean? We are paying for this. If I’m shelling out my hard earned bucks, I expect value for money!\nB:\tHere you are, sir.

Ed, don’t tell me you only have bad news!\nB:\tWell sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, fifty percent in the past month alone. We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits are falling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a\nfortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It’s a real mess.\nA:\tFor crying out loud\u0026hellip; How fast are we losing money?\nB:\tUm\u0026hellip;how can I put this?

You’re breaking up with me because I’m perfect?\nA:\tTim, you are too good for me. You deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy. Oh, I could say that I’ll be all you need, but that would be a lie. I know I’d only hurt you, I know I’d only make you cry.\nB:\tBaby, come on. Don’t do this to me! Whatever it is, we can work it out. Just give me another chance! I know that we can get through this, but we gotta stick\ntogether! Don’t leave me.\nA:\tI can’t, Tim. I hope someday you can find some way to understand I’m only doing this for you. I don’t really wanna go but, deep in my heart I know this is the kindest thing to do.\nB:\tLaura\u0026hellip;\nA:\tHere are your keys. I’ll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week. I’m sorry, Tim. I wish you all the best, and I hope that one day we can meet again. I’ll always love you. Goodbye.\nElementary\t‐\tDaily Life\t‐Registering for University (C0110) A:\tExcuse me? Is this where I register? I’d like to sign up for my courses for next semester.\nB:\tYes, of course. I need your student ID please.\nA:\tHere you are.\nB:\tOkay, Susan. It says here that you are a business major and you are in your second year. Is this information correct?\nA:\tYes. I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology.\nB:\tSure. That’s not a problem. Do you have the list of courses you want to take this semester?\nA:\tYeah. Here’s my list. I’m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though.\nB:\tYeah, that’s perfect. What about the subjects for your minor?\nA:\tOh yeah! Almost forgot! I need to take fundamental linguistics, consumer psychology and neuroanatomy.\nB:\tWow, you are going to be busy this semester!\nOkay, here you go. You are registered now; you’ll have to make your first tuition payment before classes start.\nElementary ‐ The Weekend ‐ Golf (C0111) A:\tGood morning golf aficionados! My name is Rick Fields, and you guessed it, I am here with my main man, Bob Copeland.\nB:\tThank you, Rick! As you can see, ladies and gentleman, we are here in beautiful Pebble Beach where the top golfers in the world are trying to win the grand prize of one million dollars!\nA:\tWhoa, that’s a lot of cash! Let’s go to the course and see how Tiger Woods is doing.\nB:\tAll right, were’re here at the eighth hole. It’s a par four, and has some very difficult hazards which many\ngolfers find difficult to avoid. Although, I did see Jack Nicklaus hit a hole in one on this very same hole!\nA:\tTiger Woods is about to tee off, and let’s see if he has the same luck as Jack. Tiger is asking his caddie for his driver and, he seems to be very nervous.\nB:\tOh no! Not a good swing at all! It’s definitely not his day today. On the seventh hole he got a bogey and before that he barely made par. He will definitely not get a birdie on this shot.\nA:\tIt seems that his ball has flown somewhere deep in the trees. He is having a hard time finding it and even his caddie has climbed a tree to try and spot it.\nB:\tOh no! A bear! Run, Tiger, run! Somebody call animal control!\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Dr. Plumber (C0112 ) A:\tGood afternoon! Did you call for a plumber?\nB:\tYes, yes I did. Please come in! I’m so glad you came! This old house is falling apart! Come on into the bathroom. See, here, there’s water leaking everywhere!\nA:\tI see. Let me have a look. It seems that your toilet is clogged, and that’s why it won’t flush. Let me just get my plunger. No, that’s not working either. I suspect that there’s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that’s causing a blockage. That’s what’s making your toilet overflow.\nB:\tOh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter. She is always flushing things down the toilet. You know how kids are.\nA:\tYeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. That could be causing water to not drain completely; that might lead to more problems in the future. I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn’t shutting off properly. I could have it all finished by today if it’s urgent.\nB:\tThat would be great! Is it expensive?\nA:\tLet’s see\u0026hellip; I would say about eight hundred dollars.\nB:\tWhat? That’s more than I make in a day and I’m a heart surgeon!\nElementary ‐ The Office ‐ Sorry I’m Late (C0 113) A:\tWhere is everyone? We were supposed to start fifteen minutes ago!\nB:\tJo called and said she’d be here in a sec. She said she got tied up with a client.\nC:\tSorry I’m late everyone. There was a huge traffic jam on the highway this morning.\nD:\tMorning everyone! Were you stuck in traffic as well, Jess? There was a huge pileup on the highway and traffic was backed up for miles.\nB:\tScott just called and said that he’s running late. His last meeting ran over, but he’s on his way now.\nA:\tGuys, this is not acceptable. If I say the meeting starts at ten, the meeting starts at ten. Not tenoh-one! And definitely not ten-ten! All right. Let’s get started. So the first thing I want to talk about is our\u0026hellip;\nE:\tI’m really sorry, everyone! I know I’m late. But really, it’s not my fault. I was getting a coffee at\nStarbucks, and the line was way too long. I was waiting for twenty minutes to get my coffee!\nElementary ‐ The Weekend ‐ 1980’s (C0114) A:\tJim! What’s up man!\nB:\tCharlie! Is that your ride? It’s butt ugly, dude!\nA:\tDon’t be a airhead! This is a nineteen sixty-nine Chevy Impala! I just need to fix it up a bit. In a couple of months, this baby is gonna be wicked!\nB:\tNot even! Check it out! Now that’s a fresh ride!\nA:\tToo bad the driver is a major dweeb. Anyone can have a car like that if their daddy is loaded like his.\nB:\tHe’s coming this way, be cool.\nC:\tHey guys! What do you think of my automobile?\nIsn’t it bad to the bone?\nA:\tWord! The ladies are gonna be lining up to get with you when they see you driving around in that car.\nC:\tYou really think so?\nB:\tFor sure!\nC:\tAwesome!\nA:\tPsych! haha.. you totally fell for it.\nC:\tYou are a real scumbag, Charlie. When I do the nasty with the prom queen, we’ll see who has the last laugh.\nB:\tDude, don’t have a cow!\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ I Don’t Feel So Goo d (C0115) A:\tAre you okay, man? You don’t look very well.\nB:\tUgh, I feel terrible. I went out last night with\nTrevor and things got a little out of hand.\nA:\tNice! So, where did you guys go?\nB:\tWe hit a couple of local bars, and met up with some friends. Everything was cool until Mike came along, and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday!\nA:\tOh no! Mike’s birthday is a drinkfest for sure!\nB:\tTell me about it! We drank everything in the bar!\nA:\tIs that why you missed work today?\nB:\tYeah. I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous. I threw up like five times.\nA:\tEww!\nB:\tI was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water, and my head has been pounding all day. I swear, I’m never gonna drink again!\nA:\tToo bad man, tonight is Tracy’s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go.\nB:\tOh, yeah. I’m there!\nElementary\t‐\tThe Office\t‐You MissedTheDeadline! (C0116) A:\tAnd so, I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project. As you know, you’ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week, and this will negativity impact the team’s ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.\nB:\tI know, I’m really sorry that I missed the deadline. But really, it wasn’t my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn’t get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analyis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the CRM stable, then I wouldn’t have missed my deadline.\nA:\tOh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You’re essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.\nB:\tNo, I’m not trying to pass the buck here; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn’t gone down. And you know, with everything I’ve got going on now, I can’t afford to waste time dealing with technical problems. I’ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day\u0026hellip;\nA:\tI’m not going to accept this excuse. You’re using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying\nto rationalize the fact that you’ve missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phoney excuses. If you’re in over your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by nine am!\nElementary\t‐\tTheWeekend‐\tI’m Sorry I Love You IX(C0117) Steven: Veronica wait! Come on honey, get back in the car.

I pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all.\nA:\tOur people expect their President and the Congress to find essential agreement on questions of great importance, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of our great nation. My own relations with Congress began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of the Senate appointed me to West Point. I then had the pleasure of building more intimate relationship with Congress during the war and immediate post-war period. Finally, we have progressed to the mutually interdependent relationship we’ve had during these\npast eight years.\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Supermarket Cashi er (C0122) A:\tExcuse me sir, this is the express check-out lane for people that have fifteen items or fewer.

Three of these involved our own country. Despite the carnage of these conflicts, America is today the strongest, the most influential and most productive nation in the world. We are understandably proud of this preeminence, yet we realize that America’s leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment.\nA:\tThroughout America’s adventure in free government, such basic purposes have been to keep the peace; to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity and integrity among peoples and among nations.\nA:\tWe pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all\nnations, may have their great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its spiritual blessings; that those who have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibilities; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; that the scourges of poverty, disease and ignorance will be made to disappear from the earth, and that, in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love.\nA:\tNow, on Friday noon, I am to become a private citizen.

I just want a good physique with weights and cardio.\nA:\tIn that case you want to work with less weight. You can start off by working ten to fifteen reps in four sets.

Also, be sure to use fabric softener and this detergent when washing.\nB:\tSo complicated! Ok, what about this red wine stain? How do I get it out?\nA:\tSince this is a white t-shirt, you can just pour a\nlittle bit of bleach on it and it will do the trick.\nB:\tCool. Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and its all set right?\nA:\tNo! Since you are washing delicates and cotton, you should set the dryer to medium heat and for twenty minutes.\nB:\tYou know what? I’ll just have everything dry cleaned.\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Buying a TV (C0134 ) A:\tSeriously, I don’t know why we need to get a new\nTV.\nB:\tHoney I told you already.

Bye\nB:\tCarrie, are you ok? You seem a bit down.\nA:\tI just got off the phone with my boyfriend. He is always getting upset and losing his temper over nothing. It’s so hard to talk to him at times.\nB:\tMaybe it’s just that he is stressed out from work or something. He does have a pretty nerve wracking job you know.\nA:\tYeah but, he is always in a really foul mood. I try to find out what’s bothering him or get him to talk about his day but, he always shuts down and brushes me off.\nB:\tMen are like that you know. They can feel nervous, anxious or on edge and the only way they can express it is by trying to hide it through aggressiveness.\nA:\tI guess you are right. What do you think I should do? He wasn’t always this grouchy you know\u0026hellip;\nB:\tTalk to him, try to cheer him up when he is down and if that doesn’t work, I say get rid of him and get a new one!\nA:\tYou are something else you know that?\nElementary ‐ Global View ‐ Gambling (C0136 ) A:\tDid you hear? The state is thinking of legalizing gambling in our city! Soon we are gonna have amazing hotels and casinos here which will be good for our business!\nB:\tAre you serious? Gambling is a vice industry built on deception and fed by the intentional exploitation of human weakness for the sole purpose of monetary gain! It disgusts me.\nA:\tWhat are you talking about? How does it exploit people?\nB:\tWell, to begin with, Gambling is addictive, ruins marriages, destroys families and bankrupts communities. Once you are addicted it is very difficult to stop. People have lost their houses, cars and been left out on the street after becoming addicted. Secondly, it exploits because men become addicted to gambling most often because of the action and risk. Women gamble to escape, and senior citizens will start gambling for the social interaction. Underage gamblers often start gambling on sports with friends and then illegal bookies.\nA:\tGeez! Now that I think about it, maybe legalizing gambling isn’t such a good idea! Although, I have been to Las Vegas, and I didn’t become addicted or anything like that.\nB:\tYou cannot predict who will become addicted to gambling. Now excuse me, I have a protest rally to organize!\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Getting Internet Se rvice (C0137) A:\tWelcome to Galanet. How can I help you?\nB:\tHi.

That’s why you have the reservation.\nAgent: I know why we have reservations.\nMan: I don’t think you do. If you did, I’d have a car. See, you know how to take the reservation, you just don’t know how to hold the reservation and that’s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding. Anybody can just take them.\nAgent: But we do have a compact or an SUV if you’d\nlike.\nMan: Fine. I’ll take the compact.\nAgent: Alright. We have a blue Ford Focus for you Mr. Fox.

Come here, look what I got you!\nBobby: What is that?\nDaddy: A chess board! Daddy is going to teach you how to play!\nBobby: Cool!\nDaddy: Ok, each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I’ll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, you set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally. Bobby: What about all these other pieces?\nDaddy: See this one that looks like a tower? It’s called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, it’s a very important piece so it’s best to not let your opponent capture it.\nBobby: And these two? They are husband and wife?\nDaddy: That’s right! That’s the queen and that’s the king. If the other player captures your king, he will say ”Check Mate” and the game is over! Doesn’t this sound fun?\nBobby: Nah! This is boring! I’m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation!\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Buying a Computer (C0140) Customer: So can you fix it?\nSales Clerk: I’m sorry sir. This computer is not broken or damaged. It’s simply just too old! That’s why your programs and applications are running slow. There really isn’t much I can do.\nCustomer: What do you mean? I bought this computer just three years ago!\nSales Clerk: Yes, but technology is ever changing and technology is becoming obsolete faster and faster!\nCustomer: Ok, I know where this is going. How much will it cost me to get a new computer?\nSales Clerk: Well, this desktop over here is our latest model. It has a four gigahertz processor with sixteen gigabytes in RAM and a hard disk with one terabyte.

Although, don’t you ever wonder what ”could have been”?\nA:\tWhat do you mean?\nB:\tWell, sometimes I think of how things could have turned out if I had done things a little differently.\nA:\tFor example?\nB:\tLike for example, if I hadn’t studied architecture,\nI would have become an artist like I wanted to.\nA:\tI see. Yeah now that I think of it, I wouldn’t have gotten married if I hadn’t moved to this town and met Sally.\nB:\tYou see! Everything happens for a reason! We wouldn’t even have met if I hadn’t been in that car accident ten years ago!\nA:\tWell, I have no regrets!\nB:\tI’ll drink to that!\nElementary ‐ The Weekend ‐ What Do I Wea r?

The striped short sleeved shirt with this checkered sweater and my lucky sandals. I like the cut and hemline of these shorts so I think I’ll wear these as well.\nA:\tAre you joking? What am I going to do with you? We are going to a dinner party not the beach! Wear the shirt with the silk tie I bought you and these corduroy pants. It’s chilly outside so you can wear this coat.\nB:\tThanks honey!

What can I get for you?\nGina: Id like a half a pound of ground beef, please. Butcher: Good choice! Our ground beef is extra lean, if you know what I mean.\nGina: Could I also have half a dozen pork chops and two pounds of boneless chicken breasts?\nButcher: No, no no no chicken breasts at the moment, but we have some nice chicken thighs.

I think that’s all for today.\nButcher: Okay. That will be thirty-four dollars and fifty cents.\nElementary ‐ Global View ‐ Capital Punishme nt (C0144) ProfeTsshoar:t’s all for today’s class. We will continue our lecture on crime and punishment tomorrow.\nA:\tDo you think we should be tougher on crime?\nB:\tWell, it depends on what you mean.\nA:\tFor example, we could bring back the death penalty for murder, give longer prison sentences for lesser offences and lock up juvenile offenders.\nB:\tThose really sound like Draconian measures. Firstly, what do you do about miscarriages of justice if you’ve already put innocent people to death?\nA:\tYou’d only use capital punishment if you were absolutely sure that you’d convicted the right person.\nB:\tBut, there’ve been many cases of wrongful conviction where people have been imprisoned for many years. The authorities were sure at the time, but later it was shown that the evidence was unreliable. In some cases, it’d been fabricated by the\npolice.\nA:\tWell, no system of justice can be perfect, but surely there’s a good case for longer prison sentences to deter serious crime.\nB:\tI doubt whether they could act as an effective deterrent while the detection rate is so low. The best way to prevent crime is to convince people who commit it that they’re going to be caught. It doesn’t make sense to divert all your resources into the prison system.\nA:\tBut if you detect more crimes, you’ll still need prisons. In my reckoning, if we could lock up more juvenile criminals, they’d learn that they couldn’t get away with it. Soft sentences will merely encourage them to do it again.\nB:\tYes, but remember that prisons are often schools for criminals. To remove crime from society, you really have to tackle its causes.\nA:\tWell, if I were president, I would impose tougher laws and punishment. I would have a peaceful society based on fear of punishment, not consciousness of doing the right thing.\nB:\tYou sound like a dictator!\nA:\tWell if it works, why not?\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Chicken Pox (C014 5) A:\tWhat’s wrong with you? Why are you scratching so much?\nB:\tI feel itchy! I can’t stand it anymore! I think I may be coming down with something. I feel lightheaded and weak.\nA:\tLet me have a look. Whoa! Get away from me!\nB:\tWhat’s wrong?\nA:\tI think you have chicken pox! You are contagious!\nGet away! Don’t breathe on me!\nB:\tMaybe it’s just a rash or an allergy! We can’t be sure until I see a doctor.\nA:\tWell in the meantime you are a biohazard! I didn’t get it when I was a kid and I’ve heard that you can even die if you get it as an adult!\nB:\tAre you serious? You always blow things out of proportion. In any case, I think I’ll go take an oatmeal bath.\nA:\tEwww!\nElementary ‐ Global View ‐ Animal Rights (C 0146) A:\tYou should have seen the T.V. show that was on last night, the topic it covered was really interesting; animal rights.\nB:\tDo you really believe in that? If they are going to focus on something, they should do it on civil rights.\nA:\tYes, but we cant deny that animals are vulnerable, defenseless, and are completely at the mercy of human beings.\nB:\tI understand your point, but we continue to have transgressions against human rights. If so much attention weren’t devoted to the topic of animals, we would then concentrate more on saving a human being instead of protecting a koala.\nA:\tYou can’t compare apples and oranges; I believe that both topics are important and that we can’t ignore them, the mistreatment of animals can cause a great environmental imbalance. I believe that governments should prohibit activities like poaching.\nB:\tWell, you are right on that point. This is the reason that I don’t buy leather and I try to buy synthetic products.\nB:\tAt least youre doing your part. My contribution is to have a pet in the house that I treat like a member of the family.\nA:\tAs long as you dont treat it better than your wife, its fine.\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ The Argument (C01 47) A:\tWow, that terrible movie is finally over. Next time\nI’m picking the film, because I don’t want to end up seeing a chick flick.\nB:\tWell you should have picked, in the end you always complain about everything.\nA:\tNot everything, just this film. Even the title is ridiculous; and it’s so long, those are the two and a half most wasted hours of my life, so much so that\nI’m thinking about asking them to give me my money back.\nB:\tI’m thinking of taking you back home. I thought we could have a nice evening, but you’re always so negative.\nA:\tI’m only complaining about a movie that I could have rented or bought and then thrown in the garbage.\nB:\tYou see, that’s what I’m talking about, I can’t stand your sarcastic jokes anymore\nA:\tNext time, go with your gay friend who is more in touch with his feelings.\nB:\tWell he’s more of a man than you are; at least he appreciates love stories.\nA:\tLove? More like one-night-stands.\nB:\tDon’t criticize Mario or else I’ll start on those fat, drunk friends of yours; they’re no saints.\nA:\tMy friends? Fat? What about those whales you call friends?\nB:\tYou’re unbearable; you can walk home, I’m leaving.\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Paranoid (C0148) A:\tDan, Dan dude.

You can never be too safe you know! A lot of sickos out there. Just the other day they caught that peeping tom red handed! Had a high power telescope and binoculars by his window.\nB:\tWhats the matter with you? Why are you acting all paranoid?\nA:\tParanoid? I’m not paranoid! I’m cautious! You see\nDan, we have to be on guard at all time! People just invade your privacy as if they knew you! Telemarketers, solicitors, even your bank! They have way too much information!

Be careful!\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Moving (C0149) A:\tOk, that’s fine. Bye.\nB:\tWhat happened?\nA:\tThat’s it, my lease is up. I have to move.\nB:\tWhat? Why? Can’t you renew it?\nA:\tThe owner apparently is selling this place to make way for the construction of a parking lot\nB:\tWell, I can help you pack. We should start looking for a new place for you ASAP.\nA:\tI think I might move in with my parents for a couple of months until I can find something. You know how hard it is to find a decent place around\nhere. I’m gonna have to put most of my stuff in storage for a while.\nB:\tWell, let me know if there’s anything I can do to help out.\nA:\tActually, would you mind looking after my pet tarantula and snake for a couple of weeks?\nB:\thehe.. sure\nElementary ‐ The Weekend ‐ Bug Spray (C01 50) A:\tThe mosquitos are biting me!\nB:\tMe too, I can’t stop scratching.

I’m up to my neck in work, but at least finals are coming soon and we’ll have a vacation. Where are you going now?\nB:\tI’m going to Anthropology class and now with the year anniversary of Darwin, it’s the only thing we study. Frankly, I’m sick and tired and tired of hearing about this guy.\nA:\tWhat? Why? How can you not like Darwin? I mean the man changed the entire perception of how things came to and his theory is backed by pretty solid evidence!\nB:\tI don’t like him. His theory of human evolution and natural selection is full of holes. It lacks the solid evidence of which you speak of.\nA:\tThat statement puts you at odds with half of the academy. Not to mention your professors! Furthermore, the explanation proposed by Darwin about the origin of species and the mechanism of natural selection constitutes a grand step toward a coherent understanding of the world and evolutionist\nideas.\nB:\tI’m not minimizing his grand contributions, it’s just that his theory reminds of the conundrum of the chicken and the egg.\nA:\tWhat are you talking about?\nB:\tThe question is, which was first? The chicken or the egg? I feel the same regarding his theory. How does the first cell of life come to be?\nA:\tInteresting. I think that question is better suited for my philosophy class. In the meantime, how about we settle this\u0026hellip; with a due!\nElementary ‐ The Office ‐ Cut It Out (C0152) Ed: Hey, Mary, can you cut that out?\nMary: Cut what out I’m not doing anything.\nEd: The tapping of your pen on your desk.

And plus, how can you hear it when you’re shouting into your phone all the time?\nMary: You ’ve got to be kidding me! You’re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze?\nEd: Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, and it’s probably okay to let off steam once in a while But, it’s probably not a good idea to keep it up I’m willing to forgive and forget and if you are.\nMary: Fine. Let’s call a truce. I’ll try to more considerate and to keep the noise down\nEd: Yeah, I’ll try to do the same.

Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it.\nTom: I was. It’s just that the holidays are coming up and I won’t be able to home because I can’t afford\nthe airfare. I’m just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom’s cooking and being around my family.\nSarah: Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I’d get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.\nTom: I see what you mean, but I ’m still bummed out.\nSarah: Ok how does this sound: let’s get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight. I hear that an awesome DJ is playing and there will be a lot of pretty single girls there!\nTom: You know, I could really go for that. You don’t mind being my wingman for tonight?\nSarah: Not at all!

I never knew you had a great aunt!\nFatheWr:ell, the family doesn’t talk about her or get near her, for that matter.\nKid: Why is that?\nFatheCr:ome on, we have to go.\nB:\tSo we arrived at this old house on the outskirts of\nour town. There was almost no one around and the house had an eerie look to it. Once inside the house, we walked to her room and I was surprised to find my dad’s great aunt in a wheelchair, yelling at someone, but we were alone in the room. FatheHr:i, aunt Ursula! This is my son Tony.\nUrsulWa:hy have you come? Why are you here? Don’t you know it isn’t safe? My time is near, he is coming for me.\nKid: Who is coming for you?\nUrsulTah: e prince of darkness! The lord of the underworld, the tempter, the old serpent. FatheCr:ome on, aunt Ursula let’s lay you down. You need to get some rest. Tony, help me lay her down.\nB:\tThat night, we slept in one of the 12 rooms of that big old mansion. The trees outside seemed to come alive and their shadows formed ghoulish shapes on my bed. All of a sudden, we heard screaming.\nUrsulAah: hh! Get off me beast! I won’t let you take me! Ahhh!\nKid: Dad! Dad! Something is attacking aunt Ursula!\nUrsulUa:rsula: Take your claws off me! Go back to the underworld you demon! I shall be judged before you can take me!\nFatheTrh: e door is jammed! Stand back! Aunt Ursula! Where are you?\nKid: Over here!\nB:\tAnd as we approached her, she was lying on the floor, with her hands and feet open like the Vitruvian Man, breathing heavily with bloody marks and scratches on her arms, legs and face. Remember how I mentioned that she was in a wheel chair? My aunt had been paralyzed from the neck down for just over a year. After this incident, strange things would happen in the house and my aunt would yell and scream, according to her, warding off the evil that had come to get her. As the days passed, she became very weak and eventually was unable to talk. My dad had to work during the day, so I was left to care for her. When she lost her voice and laid on her death bed, I would hear her breathe, in and out.\nB:\tUntil finally one day, she breathed in\u0026hellip; and never exhaled. That night, I felt relieved that it was finally over, but it wasn’t.\nB:\tI was so terrified of what I was hearing, that I didn’t sleep all night. The following morning, I went to the bathroom, expecting to find a mess and everything torn up, but I found everything exactly as it was before. The movers came that same day and\nas we were cleaning out her drawers and personal items, we found strange notebooks with names and amounts of money written next to them. We found pictures with people’s faces sewn with black or red string. And you want to know what the strangest thing was? There was a small doll, filled with dead ants, with a strand of hair tied around it’s waist, and on the doll’s face, there was a picture of me with the numbers: ”311009”. You know what date it is today?

Why do we have to do that?\nA:\tWell, at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon. This is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth. In any case, to take better advantage of the daylight available, we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour.\nB:\tI see. That’s convenient! I never understood things like this, such as GMT. I never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock!\nA:\tThat just stands for Greenwich Mean Time. Here in California, we are in Pacific Standard Time, that is eight time zones west of Greenwich. Remember when we were in Beijing? Well, then we were in\nChina Standard Time, and that’s eight time zones east of Greenwich!\nB:\tThat’s why it was so weird traveling from Beijing to LA!

It’s important we make a clean break. I should\nhave signed a pre-nup.\nJe: What was that?\nJoanne: Nothing! Anyway, you’re right, there’s no reason this has to be nasty. My lawyer tells me you’ve accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement- I keep the cat and you get the dog. So that’s done. . . . finally.\nJe: Let’s not go there, Joanne! Ok, so let’s start with the record collection, I’ll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back.\nJoanne: Fine, but I’m keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me.\nJe: I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne.

Alright, I’ll concede the silly gramophone, if you’ll agree that I get the silver tea set.\nJoanne:How typical, when are you ever going to use a silver tea set? Fine!

There have been tons of scientific studies and the scientific community says that the earth is heating up. We need to make some drastic changes to our lifestyle if we want to preserve our planet.\nA:\tI don’t know. It sounds like a bunch of mumbo\njumbo if you ask me. ”Save the earth!” The earth will save itself. It’s survived worst disasters in the past. I mean, honestly, we live in the boonies. There’s no way anyone here is ever going to walk or bike to work, especially in the winter. And we have no bus system. My house is forty years old and it would take a lot of money to get it refitted to be ”green” and ”energy-efficient”.\nC:\tWell I don’t really know if I believe in global warming either, or whether or not it was our doing or a natural change the earth is going through, but you have to admit that we’re living pretty irresponsibly here in the west.\nA:\tI guess\u0026hellip;\nC:\tI think the issue at hand is sustainability. We’ve only got this one earth we can live on, and our resources are quickly disappearing because of our own carelessness and our inability to think of anyone but ourselves and anything but the present.\nB:\tSo, like I was saying, we need to change the way we live. We need to reduce our carbon footprint.\nC:\tBut it doesn’t have to be that drastic. Hybrid vehicles and solar panels are too expensive to be feasible right now. And we don’t have to be hippies living off the land and buying everything organic either, though it helps.\nB:\tI car pool to work everyday with some buddies of mine. I have a rain barrel outside my house I use to water my plants and my lawn in the summer, and I make sure I always bring reusable bags with me when I get my groceries. And we just started using bio-degradable plastic made from corn oil for take-out orders at my family’s restaurant. Remember the three R’s? Reduce. Reuse. Recycle.\nC:\tExactly, it’s just small simple changes, like buying energy-saving light bulbs, starting a compost bin, recycling bottles and papers, using reusable water bottles, stop using disposable cups and cutlery.\nA:\tLike the ones we’re drinking out of?\nB:\tYeah.\nElementary ‐Daily Life ‐ Facial Hair (C0223) Officer: Ok Sally, we have an artist here to help us.\nBrown: We’ll ask you questions about the bank robber you saw and Paul will draw a picture.

Perhaps we can start by discussing your background and resume details a little?\nRebecca Carlyle: Yes , of course.\nElementary ‐ Daily Life ‐ Trying To Sleep (C0236) Jill: Alex, what’s up with you? You look dreadful!\nAlex: Hey Jill, I don’t know. I’ve been having trouble sleeping these past few weeks. I usually lie in bed for hours trying to get to sleep . I’ve tried stretching and different breathing techniques before going to bed . I’ve tried eating and not eating different foods. I’ve even tried counting sheep! And then when I finally get to sleep , I have these really disturbing nightmares, so I usually wake up in a panic and more tired than before I went to sleep .\nJill: Wow, maybe you should get that checked out. Maybe you’re stressed?\nC:\tJust take some sedatives! Works for me! Every so often having some melatonin on hand helps me when I have trouble sleeping. It works on all kinds of sleeping disorders. It’s the stuff pilots use to regulate their sleeping patterns.\nJill: I heard of that. But does that apply to Alex’s situation?\nC:\tYa sure, why not? Sounds like he only has transient insomnia since it’s a recent thing so taking melatonin do the trick.\nJill: But shouldn’t he be looking into WHY it’s been happening?\nC:\tWell aren’t you the little psychologist? Our buddy’s having trouble sleeping, it’s easy and curable. It’s not something freakish like if he was a sleepwalker.\nAlex: Well, there’s that too.\nElementary\t‐ Daily Life ‐ Morning Routine (C0237) Jacob: Stephanie! Did you just get to school? But you were up and about when I left the dorm this morning! That was about an hour and a half ago. This happens all the time! Why do you always take so long to get ready the morning?\nStephanie: It’s a skill. What can I say? I don’t know why, I just have a long routine.\nJacob: Please explain because it makes no sense to me. How can a girl’s routine be so complicated? You get up, you shower, you get dressed , you brush your teeth, you’re out the door. Half an hour, tops.\nStephanie: Jacob, you have the luxury of having a haircut that rarely needs styling. I don’t. I have to set aside about an hour and a half to get ready in the mornings. Every day, I wake up and head straight for the shower. Every second day, I wash my hair. If it’s a hair-washing day, I frequently need to wash my hair twice because it gets really oily. Then I usually put in a conditioner and have to rinse that out too. Because my hair is so long, I seldom manage to take a shower in under twenty minutes. Afterwards, I often put on a pot of coffee and get dressed while I wait for it to brew. I take a long time to get dressed in the morning. Every now and then I remember to choose my outfit the night before , but usually I do it in the morning. In all, getting dressed takes about half an hour , at which time my hair is now semi-dry so then I have to style my hair. From time to time I’ll put my hair up, but oftentimes I blowdry it straight. And then, because of the texture of my hair, I regularly have to flat-iron it to keep it from frizzing. That’s another twenty minutes or so. After that, I have my daily makeup routine.\nJacob: True, I hardly ever see you without your hair done and your makeup on, even when you show up to class in sweatpants. Tell me, how long does it take you to choose that outfit in the morning?\nStephanie: Not funny.\nElementary\t‐The Office ‐ Interview Skills Part 2 ‐ Discuss ing Your Background (C0238) Mr. Parsons: Now, Miss Childs passed on your resume to me and I’ve had the chance to look it over and I must say I’m quite impressed.\nRebecca: Thank you very much.

If there’s any questions please feel free to ask me.\nMr. Parsons: Well yes, I do have a number of questions, but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I’d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background.\nRebecca: yes of course. Well as you can see from the resume I’m up and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, although our family moved to London when I was quite young, at around rook.\nMr. Parsons: Ah I see, so you were actually educated in Europe?\nRebecca: yes precisely. Although I was born in the US, I would definitely call London home. But as you see I’ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country. My Father was inthe oil business before he retired so we also spent a number of years in Saudi Arabia too.\nMr. Parsons: Very interesting. So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood.\nRebecca: Absolutely! We were never still for too long. But now I’m really looking to settle down. Mr. Parsons: I see.

Now I see that after graduating from University your first job was\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;.\nRebecca: For a local paper in York called the York Herald. Actually, I started with them as an intern in the beginning. I was really keen on getting some experience in the journalistic world, and this seemed like a good first step.\nMr. Parsons: Certainly. And after your internship\nRebecca: They seemed impressed, and offered me\na position as a junior local news reporter. I ended up staying two years there actually.

I see you spent almost four years at the London Weekly , is that right?\nRebecca: Yes, that’s right. To be honest, the first year was quite tough for me.

I spent restaurant years in that position, but to be honest it wasn’t an area of journalism I wanted to stay in long-term.\nMr. Parsons: I see, so why did you decide to leave finally?\nRebecca: I just felt that the paper couldn’t offer me any new opportunities. I really needed a more challenging role to be honest.\nDaily Life ‐ Dinnerware (C0248)\nA:\tHoney can you set the table?\nB:\tUm, sure. What are we having for dinner?

Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let’s get started !\nA:\tLet’s start with the basics :bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing -choose the bread according to the following criteria :freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color.\nA:\tNow that our bread is ready, let’s talk about the ingredients ! Of course, each person’s palate is different, but I’m going to give you a few tips that you’ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich.\nA:\tDo not undervalue them as they play a big role in\nforming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident- cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs-you can’t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil.\nA:\tLast but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It’s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt!\nA:\tThat’s all the time we have for today, but join us\nnext time where we’ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next time!\nThe Office ‐ Interview Skills 6 ‐ Describing O nes\nStrengths (C0250)\nMr. Parsons: Okay Rebecca. Now youyou’ve given me a good idea of your work and academic background, but what about you as a person? How would you describe your key strengths?\nRebecca: Well Mr. Parsons, as I mentioned before I’m someone who needs new challenges. I’m really focused and hard hard-working. I think my academic results prove this.\nMr. Parsons: Yes, true, but how about other personal qualities? Hmmmmm, that\u0026rsquo;s a tough question. But I would have to say my passion. I\u0026rsquo;m really passionate about journalism and passionate about my career.\nRebecca: Well I believe I’m a good team-player, but I can also work well independently. I’m very enthusiastic and , well I hope my colleagues would agree, I’m fun to work with.\nMr. Parsons: What would you say is your most positive quality?\nRebecca: Hmmmmm, that’s a tough question. But I would have to say my passion.

We have been here for almost an hour! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish!\nB:\tAre you crazy! You have no idea what you are talking about! Just for my eyes I have to get eyeliner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow, an eyebrow pencil and mascara. Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.\nA:\tWhoa whoa whoa! Are you nuts? How much is all this going to cost? I’m looking at the price at each\none of these little things and it’s outrageous! This is basically a crayon!\nB:\tWhat about you? You spend as much or more money on your razors, after shave, cologne and gel! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and\u0026hellip;\nA:\tFine! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon!\nGlobal View ‐ Contraceptives (C0252)\nA:\tAlright, settle down everyone. As part of this school’s curriculum we’ll be covering sex ed this week.\nA:\tNow I want everyone to take this class seriously, sexual education is very important and I want you to ask as many questions as you can think of. Remember, there are no stupid questions here.\nB:\tMiss Carlton? What exactly is sexual education? Are you going to teach us like Kama sutra stuff like that?\nA:\tNo Jason, that’s not exactly what sex ed is.\nBasically, we will talk about sexually transmitted diseases, contraceptives and how the male and female bodies work.\nB:\tMy older sister is in college and she takes what she and her friends call the pill. I never really understood what that is, but I know it has to do with sex or something.\nA:\tGood point Jason! This will be the topic of our first class, contraceptives. As you mentioned, the pill is one of the many that exist. The birth control pill is taken daily by a woman in order to prevent unwanted pregnancy, but it does not protect her from contracting STD’s from an infected person.\nAnother popular method is using condoms. This is probably the best method if you have sex, since it not only prevents a woman from getting pregnant but also protects both from STD’s. Yes Jason?\nB:\tWhat are condoms made out of? How exactly is it that a woman gets pregnant?\nA:\tCondoms are usually made out of an elastic material called Latex. As for your other question, that’s a whole new class.\nThe Office ‐ Interview Skills 7 ‐ Describing O nes\nWeaknesses (C0253)\nMr. Parsons: Okay Rebecca, well I think you’ve given me a clear impression of your positive qualities, but let’s talk a little bit about your weaknesses.\nRebecca: Okay, well it’s always more difficult to describe them isn’t it?\nMr. Parsons: Definitely, but if you had to pinpoint one weakness what would it be?\nRebecca: Well as I mentioned before, I do tend to get frustrated if I don’t see progress in my work or career. I suppose I’m quite a restless character. My father always taught me to be a high achiever so.\nMr. Parsons: So would you say if things don’t go your way at work it could easily get you down? Rebecca: Well, in a way yes. But I must say that even if I’m not completely happy in my work I always give 110% I would never shirk my responsibilities. I suppose sometimes Iexpect too much too soon. Mr. Parsons: Well, you know journalism is a highly competitive world, so you do need to keep pushing yourself it’s true. Okay well lets move on to talk about the job position here shall we? Rebecca: Yes please.\nThe Weekend ‐ Making Breakfast (C0254)\nA:\tSmells good! What’s for breakfast?\nB:\tWell, since we are getting up so late, I decided to make a big breakfast!\nA:\tNice!

Did you make any coffee?\nB:\tYeah, just the way you like it! I also put out some cereal and muesli if you feel like having something more light.\nA:\tLooks good! I’ll squeeze us some fresh orange juice.\nB:\tGet the jam and butter while you are in there! Oh!\nAnd don’t forget the syrup!\nGlobal View ‐ The Miracle Of Life (C0255)\nA:\tContinuing with our class, today we are going to study briefly the miracle of life. Many of you may think you already know how babies come to be, but I am sure that some of the things that we will be talking about today may surprise you. Billy can you turn on the projector please? Thanks. Ok, does anyone know what this is?\nB:\tLooks like a goat head to me!\nA: Nice try, but this is a woman’s womb which\ncontains her uterus and ovaries. The ovaries are packed with eggs and each month during the middle of the menstrual cycle, the ripest one will be sucked up by one of the fallopian tubes. This is called ovulation and the exact time of ovulation depends on the length of your cycle. In an average 28 day cycle, ovulation will most likely happen between the 12th and 15th days, counting day 1 as the first day of your last period.\nB:\tThat’s amazing! So each month, the woman produces these eggs and then waits for them to be fertilized?\nA:\tActually, every woman is already born with over four hundred thousand eggs! Some will start dying off immediately and others released during her fertile period.\nB:\tWhat about the guys? I know they produce sperm and stuff.\nA:\tThat’s right! The man’s body has a tiny factory that produces sperm twenty four hours a day! Each ejaculation will release about a hundred million sperm so the factory is always pretty busy. The sole purpose of a sperm’s life is to fertilize the woman’s egg.\nB:\tSo, then we basically need to put one-and-one together so we can have babies right?\nA:\tYes, the man will have an orgasm during intercourse and ejaculate sperm and semen. Now this is where the race begins and all those millions of sperm will race and swim from the cervix, through the uterus to the fallopian tubes. This could take anywhere from forty five minutes to twelve hours! Not all of them make it, since some go the wrong way and get lost or simply die. Many will actually reach the egg but only one will penetrate it and fertilize it. Once this happens, the egg instantly changes and creates a protective shield once the sperm is safely inside.\nB:\tAnd then? That’s it?\nA:\tWell, the egg will be fertilized within about 24 hours of its release. The genetic material from the sperm combines with the genetic material in the egg to create a new cell that will rapidly start dividing. The woman is not actually pregnant until that bundle of new cells, known as the embryo, travels the rest of the way down the fallopian tube and attaches itself to the wall of her uterus. Any other questions? Then let’s move on.\nThe Office ‐ Interview Skills 8 ‐ Discussing S\nalary and Benefits (C0256)\nMr. Parsons: Okay, well I’m sure you have a number of questions to ask me regarding the position.\nRebecca: Yes, well Miss Childs did give me an overview of the position over the phone, but there were some details I’d like to clarify.\nMr. Parsons: Well feel free to ask me anything, and I’ll try to fill in the details.\nRebecca: Could I first ask about the remuneration package?\nMr. Parsons: Yes of course. That’s quite an important point isn’t it? As a junior sub editor we offer a starting salary of 150,000 HK dollars per annum. This doesn’t include a generous housing allowance also.\nRebecca: I understand. And are there other bonuses included?\nMr. Parsons: Well apart from full health insurance we do offer a company staff bonus scheme linked to readership numbers. But we could go through all the details of that at a later date.\nRebecca: Well Mr. Parsons, I am flexible when it comes to salary. The opportunity to work in Hong Kong for you is the most important thing for me.\nMr. Parsons: Excellent. Well, what other questions do you have Rebecca?\nGlobal View ‐ The World Cup (C0257)\nA:\tWhat are you doing?\nB:\tWhat am I doing? What am I doing? Don’t you know what day it is?\nA:\tUmmm. no.\nB:\tIt’s only the day when the world’s biggest sporting event is kicking off.\nA:\tWhat?\nB:\tThe World Cup! The first match is today! It’s Mexico vs. South Africa! It’s going to be a really good match! Both teams have a very strong offense and have skilled players. I think that South Africa will probably dominate the first half since they are the host country, and all.\nA:\tI have no idea what you’re talking about. The only sporting event we watch at home is the Super Bowl.\nB:\tThis is bigger than the Super Bowl, man! Teams from 32 countries compete against each other every\nfour years and fight to win that trophy. They first start in a group stage with bigger groups, each group having 4 teams. The top 2 teams pass on to an elimination stage before going on to the quarterfinals and semifinals.\nA:\tSounds interesting, but soccer doesn’t really appeal to me.\nB:\tAre you kidding? Over seven hundred million people watched the final match of the World Cup! It’s a very exciting and nerve wracking sport! Each nation is cheering on their team, hoping they will become the next champion. So far Brazil is the team with the most titles under their belt; they’re really good!\nA:\tAll I know about soccer is that you can’t use your hands and that players are always falling down, trying to get a free kick or penalty kick. It seems like a sissy sport to me!\nB:\tWhatever dude, I’m going to go watch the opening match.\nDaily Life ‐ You’re Grounded! (C0258)\nA:\tDo you know what time it is?\nB:\tUm. Ten?\nA:\tGet in this door young man. It’s midnight, you are two hours past curfew.\nB:\tI know, but it wasn’t my fault! I told Jennifer she had to drop me off before ten, but she wouldn’t leave the party!\nA:\tI don’t care! You are grounded for life mister!\nB:\tMom! That is so unfair!\nA:\tYou know the rules and you broke them. No allowance and no TV for a week. I usually never ground you but this time I have to put my foot down!\nB:\tWhat! For being a couple of hours late? You have to be kidding!\nA:\tI don’t want to hear it! Now go to your room!\nAbout The Position (C0259)\nRebecca: Could you tell me a little about the organization?\nFor example, how big is your\nworkforce here?\nMr. Parsons: Well in total we have around 150 employees based in Hong Kong with another 400 in our head office in Beijing. The news desk staff in Hong Kong comprises around 80 staff.\nRebecca: I see. And how about the working hours?\nMr. Parsons: Well, as you know Rebecca, in journalism work hours are not exactly 9-5. You could be on call at any time. We do have to work very unsociable hours at times. Rebecca: Well I am used to that Mr. Parsons, so that’s not really a shock for me.\nMr. Parsons: Good, as long as you understand that. Rebecca: And when do you need to fill the vacancy, Mr. Parsons?\nMr. Parsons: Yesterday! But no, we are hoping to start from the beginning of next month. Rebecca: That sounds ideal.\nThe Weekend ‐ Guns (C0260)\nA:\tHey Nick, what are you up to?\nB:\tNot much, just heading over to the shooting range. You wanna come?\nA:\tSeriously? You mean to fire a real weapon? I don’t know man.\nB:\tYeah it will be fun! I have a 9mm pistol that is really easy to shoot. I also have a revolver that’s really fun too! They have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim.\nA:\tYeah that would be cool! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile! Or what about a flame thrower!\nB:\tWhoa, take it easy there Rambo. Don’t get carried away. These weapons are not toys, and you must first learn how to handle them properly. There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe. For example, never handle a weapon that you haven’t inspected yourself. Always make sure there isn’t anything in the chamber, and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot!\nA:\tWow, I didn’t know! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies!\nB:\tThe reality is different you know, running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies! So are you ready?\nA:\tLet’s do it!\nDaily Life ‐ Describing Someone’s Face (C026 1)\nA:\tLet’s play a game!\nB:\tOk! How about Scrabble?\nA:\tNo no, a friend of mine taught me this really fun game. I’m going to describe someone’s face, and you guess who it is!\nB:\tOk!\nA:\tLet’s see. He has a roman nose, bushy eyebrows and dimples!\nB:\tOur cousin Pete! My turn! She has a pointy nose, sunken eyes and a mole on her chin!\nA:\tAunt Rose! That mole is so huge! Ok, my turn. He has a crooked nose and full lips. He has quite a few freckles and an oval face. Oh, he is also bald!\nB:\tYour future husband!\nA:\tNot funny.\nThe Office ‐ Interview Skills 10 ‐ Concluding The Interview (C0262)\nMr. Parsons: Well Rebecca, is there anything else you need to know for now?\nRebecca: I don’t think so Mr. Parsons. I think you have covered all the main points for me.\nMr Parsons: Okay well listen, here is my business card with my mobile number. If any other questions spring to mind don’t hesitate to contact me. Of course you can also call Miss Childs too.\nRebecca: Great. Ermm, when can I expect to hear from you?\nMr. Parsons: Well, we are finishing the shortlist interviews tomorrow, so we will certainly have a decision made by early next week. Miss Childs will call you to discuss more on Monday or Tuesday. How does that sound?\nRebecca: That sounds perfect. Thank you very much for taking the time to speak to me Mr. Parsons. Mr. Parsons: The pleasure’s all mine Rebecca.\nRebecca: I hope to hear from you very soon.\nMr. Parsons: Absolutely. Thanks for coming Rebecca. Goodbye.\nGlobal View ‐ Nationalities (C0263)\nA:\tHey! How was your first day of class? I’m in level two and I’m loving my class this semester! It’s great being in a class of international students!\nB:\tMine was ok, except that no one in my class speaks English. I guess it will force me to converse in Chinese more in class so at least I should improve a lot this semester.\nA:\tThat’s both fortunate and unfortunate. It’s the\nUnited Nations in my class! We have people from all over the world! There are three Germans, a Pole, a Scottish, two French, an American, a Brazilian, a Chilean, a New Zealander, though he prefers to call himself a Kiwi. Who else do we have? Oh, we also\nhave a Moroccan, a Togolese, a Pakistani, and two Indonesians!\nB:\tThat’s quite the array of nationalities. Everyone in my class is from Asia, except me. There are a few South Koreans, several Japanese, Malaysian, Thai, Singaporean, Filipino, Kazakhstani, and one Russian.\nA:\tWell, I think you’re pretty lucky actually. You’ll have the opportunity to learn so much about Asian culture.\nB:\tI guess so, but I think it’s going to be hard to relate to my classmates, especially with the language barrier. I think I might change classes.\nA:\tDon’t! Stay the course! Your spoken Chinese will be eternally grateful. I bet you it will even surpass mine with all that practice.\nB:\tI highly doubt it. Your girlfriend is Chinese.\nA:\tWell, there is that, yes.\nDaily Life ‐ Toothache (C0264)\nA:\tWhat seems to be the problem?\nB:\tI have a really bad toothache! My cheek is swollen and I can’t eat anything.\nA:\tLet’s have a look. Hmmm. This doesn’t look too good. I think we may have to pull out your wisdom tooth. It’s pressing against your molars and that’s one of the reasons you are experiencing so much pain.\nB:\tWhen you pull my tooth will you also have to extract the nerve and the root?\nA:\tFirst we will take some x-rays and see what we’re dealing with. I also noticed a small cavity up front here, so you are going to need a filling.\nB:\tI guess that’s what I get for not flossing or brushing my teeth three times a day.\nA:\tIt could be that, or maybe you are eating too many sweets. In any case, I’ll administer an anesthetic and you won’t feel a thing!\nThe Weekend ‐ Pest Control (C0265)\nA:\tHi, did you call for an exterminator?\nB:\tYes! Thank goodness you’re here. These bugs are driving us crazy!\nA:\tWhat sort of pest are we dealing with?\nB:\tWe just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything. We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard!\nA:\tWell, there’s nothing we can’t handle. I’ll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will be harder to get rid of. We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it. Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.\nB:\tNo problem, just get rid of the bugs!\nDaily Life ‐ Weather Report (C0266)\nA:\tThose are today’s top stories. Now let’s go to John for the weather. John, what does the forecast look like for our weekend travelers?\nB:\tI’m afraid we’re in for a rough weekend, Mark.\nThere is a storm system moving through the East\nCoast. It will be drizzling all day today, and there’s a\n60 percent chance of thunderstorms this evening. It will be warm and humid all weekend. In the Midwest, expect strong winds and a low of around 40 degrees.\nA:\tThat’s pretty chilly for the summer! Will it rain on Saturday?\nB:\tUnfortunately, yes. It will be clear early Saturday morning but there is a high chance of showers and thunderstorms later in the day. There is a severe thunderstorm warning for some parts of the Southeast. Folks in those areas might see some hail and flooding, especially in areas that have been experiencing record high rainfalls.\nA:\tThat certainly sounds like a dreary Saturday.\nB:\tIt gets better on Sunday, though. The storm systems move east and the skies will clear up at night. It will still be rather cool, with highs in the low 50s. The West Coast will be experiencing some unusually chilly weather, but at least the sun will come out. I advise weekend travelers to be careful, especially while driving. Back to you, Mark.\nA:\tThanks John, and there you have it! Looks like it’s a weekend to stay at home!\nDaily Life ‐ Making A Bank Transfer (C0267)\nA:\tGood Morning welcome to Bank of the USA. How may I help you today?\nB:\tHi I need to transfer some money to another account. It’s urgent.\nA:\tOkay, have you made a wire transfer at our bank before ?\nB:\tNo. I’ve never made a transfer before.\nA:\tIt’s alright, I will take you through the procedure.\nAre you transferring funds to a company or an\nindividual account?\nB:\tA company account. I need to pay a bill.\nA:\tOkay, I’ll need the name of the company and their bank routing number as well as their bank’s address and phone number.\nB:\tI have all the information in this folder.\nA:\tWell You’ve come prepared .You have all the necessary materials so we can go ahead and make the transfer right now. It’s a simple transaction, and we can process it today.\nB:\tOh, that’s such a relief. I didn’t want the payment to be overdue. Thank you so much .\nA:\tIt’s my pleasure.\nThe Office ‐ Purchasing Manager (C0268)\nA:\tGood morning, Angela, how have you been lately?\nB:\tMorning, Michael. I’ve been very busy lately. One of our other vendors is going out of business and I’ve been searching for a suitable replacement.\nA:\tWell, rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run sit down. Coffee?\nB:\tNo, thanks. I’ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .\nA:\tHaha, I could never do that. I’d be a zombie if I didn’t have my morning coffee fix. Let’s get down to business then.\nB:\tYes. I’ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new MePhone. The demand for phone cameras is growing, and Pear has been falling behind in the market.\nA:\tThat’s great! I’m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon. Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras. Is Pear still interested in having those?\nB:\tNo, we’re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels. We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal.\nA:\tSurely. Let’s get started by drafting a new contract.\nThe Office ‐ Marketing Plan (C0269)\nA:\tOkay everyone, let’s begin. I called you here today to evaluate our marketing strategy during this recession. I wanted to re-emphasize our corporate mission of Aiming to give our customers the best coffee and service in a clean and welcoming atmosphere.\nB:\tSeveral other shops have reduced the prices for their coffees and are drawing in more customers.\nWhy aren’t we doing the same thing?\nA:\tI know that recent sales have been slow, but we are not going to reduce our prices to the level of our competitors. We offer a superior product and our focus is on long-term growth rather than shortterm sales. If we lower our prices, we run the risk of devaluing our product.\nB:\tCustomers don’t care about the coffee anymore.\nThey only care about the price.\nA:\tI disagree. Highly discerning customers know that our coffee is far better than the coffee you buy at the other places. Our coffee bean are artisan roasted and we use state-of-the-art equipment to brew our coffees. When you compare the coffees side-by-side our coffee wins the taste test every time. We have never sought to appeal to the mass market with cheap coffee drinks, and we will not do so now.\nC:\tThat’s true. We’ve certainly achieved top of mind awareness when it comes to the best best tasting brews and it’s important to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. I think the main question is how we can show our appreciation to our customers.\nA:\tThat’s the main question I would like to discuss today.\nB:\tMoney is tight for everyone these days so even our most loyal customers may be reconsidering the money they pay for their morning coffee. Since the superiority of our coffee beans is one of our core competencies why don’t we sell the beans for people to brew coffee at home.\nC:\tThat could definitely be a way we could expand our company, but would we be undermining the essence of the company that way?\nA:\tLet’s brainstorm some more ideas, and do some research. The customer always comes first, and what the customer wants, the customer gets. Maybe it’s time we started selling coffee beans.\nDaily Life ‐ Buying A Suit (C0270)\nA:\tHello sir, what can I do for you today?\nB:\tHi, I need a new suit. I have an important interview next week, so I really need to look sharp.\nA:\tNo problem! We have a broad selection of suits, all tailored made so that it will fit perfectly.\nB:\tGreat! I want a three piece suit, preferably made from Italian cashmere or wool.\nA:\tVery well sir. Would you like to have some shirts\nmade also?\nB:\tSure. I’ll also take some silver cuff link and a pair of silk ties.\nA:\tVery good. Now, if you will accompany me, we can take your measurements and choose the patterns for your suit and shirts.\nThe Office ‐ Presentation Series 1 ‐ The Over view and the Agenda (C0271)\nA:\tHi everyone, Can everyone hear me?Can you guys at the back hear everything?\nA:\tOkay great. Well I think all of you know why we are here this afternoon. As most of you are aware 2010 marks an important moment for Alpha computers.\nA:\tWe have bounced back from the recession and now we are set to launch our new line of laptop and desktop computers.\nA:\tI’m really pleased to welcome Michael Ford, the\nGlobal Marketing Manager for Alpha computers, who has flown in from California to give all of you an overview of the marketing campaign and to answer any questions you may have. So please give a warm welcome to Mr. Ford.\nB:\tThank you Jonathan. It really is a pleasure to be here today. It has been three years since I visited\nBeijing ,and it’s clear to me that operations here are obviously going from strength to strength.\nB:\tThe Alpha brand continues to grow in leaps and bounds in China, and that is certainly down to the hard work of all of you here. So congratulations to all of you.\nB:\tI’d like to start by outlining the key points of my presentation this afternoon and giving you an idea of the topics that will be discussed. The presentation today is divided into five main parts.\nB:\tFirst of all, I’d like to briefly touch on the background of the new x420 line; how the whole concept has come about and how the new product fits into our existing brand line.\nB:\tSecondly I’dlike to present data on projected sales for the x420. We will then go on to discuss our key rivals in this sector. Then I would like to go on to outline the campaign concept for the x420.\nB:\tFinally I’m happy to open up the discussion for any questions or points you might have for me.\nDaily Life ‐ Getting A Nanny (C0272)\nGrace: Hey Mel! Are you up for some tennis today?\nMel: Sorry, I can’t! I have to go to work, pick up Jake and Maddie from school, and make them an afternoon snack, then take Jake to soccer practice and Maddie to dance class.\nGrace: You sound exhausted. Maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out! She can pick the kids up and take them to their after-school activities. She can also help you do some household chores, and run some errands.\nMel: Oh, I don’t know\u0026hellip; it’s hard to find the right nanny .You have to consider her previous work experience, the responsibilities you give her, and how she interacts with the kids. I would love to have someone to help me out, though.\nGrace: I think you should definitely consider it! This way you won’t have to juggle such a busy schedule, and you’ll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings. I can refer you this great nanny Amy. She used to work for my neighbors, before they moved away. She’s very responsible, a good cook, and great with kids.\nMel: Oh, that’s great. Thanks Grace. Can you give me her number? I’ll talk it over with Dan and give her a call tomorrow. Maybe this way I won’t be so tired every day, and Dan and I might even get to go on a date once in a while .\nThe Weekend ‐ The Zodiac and Horoscopes ( C0273)\nAngela: Hey Lydia, what are you reading?\nLydia: I’m looking at my horoscope for this month! My outlook is very positive. It says that I should take a vacation to someplace exotic, and that I will have a passionate summer fling!\nAngela: What are you talking about? Let me see that. . . What are horoscopes?\nLydia: It’s a prediction of your month, based on your zodiac sign . You have a different sign for the month and date you were born in. I was born on April 15th, so I’m an Aries. When were you born?\nAngela: January 5th.\nLydia: Let’s see. . . you’re a Capricorn. It says that you will be feeling stress at work, but you could see new, exciting developments in your love life . Looks like we’ll both have interesting summers!\nAngela: That’s bogus. I don’t feel any stress at work, and my love life is practically nonexistent. This\nzodiac stuff is all a bunch of nonsense.\nLydia: No it’s not, your astrology sign can tell you a lot about your personality. See? It says that an Aries is energetic and loves to socialize. Angela: Well, you certainly match those criteria, but they’re so broad they could apply to anyone. What does it say about me?\nLydia: A Capricorn is serious-minded and practical. She likes to do things in conventional ways. * laughs * That sounds just like you!\nThe Office ‐ Presentation Series 2 ‐ Talking about numbers, charts and graphs (C0274)\nMr Ford: As all of you are well aware, competition in the laptop computer sector is intense.\nMr Ford: We continue to fight with our competitors for market share, and this is the case both in the developed markets in the West, as well as more developing markets in Asia and Africa.\nMr Ford: You may ask yourself, why is this market so cut-throat? Well the answer is simple. There is a huge untapped potential market out there, with a huge untapped potential for profit.\nMr Ford: If I bring up the first graph here, it shows the increase in terms of number of computer owners across the globe.\nMr Ford: As you can see in the 1980’s computer ownership amounted to around 0.5% of the total world population. Since the 1990’s, computer ownership has risen dramatically.\nMr Ford: In the new millennium we saw an even larger explosion in computer owners , with figures rising to around 4- 5%, an increase of 1000 % percent compared with the 1980’s .\nMr Ford: If we move on to discuss the figures for China specifically we can see in Chart B that the overall figure for computer ownership stands at around 60 million, which represents a huge increase in a very short time period.\nMr Ford: Now of course 60 million is just a drop in the ocean if you compare the total population of China, and this is a key reason why the personal computer market is such a hot market.\nMr Ford: For us at Alpha, and of course for all our competitors as well, we have millions of potential customers who are looking to join the internet generation.\nMr Ford: If we do this right we really can reap huge\nrewards in a very short time frame. I’d now like to move on to discuss the x420 brand itself, and compare and contrast with some of our key competitors.\nDaily Life ‐ Kitchen Appliances (C0275)\nA:\tI have been looking at this online catalog for over an hour and I still haven’t finished getting all the kitchen appliances that we need!\nB:\tWhat are you getting?\nA:\tWell, the first thing on my list is a new blender. I decided to also get a juicer and a new coffee maker.\nB:\tDon’t forget to also get a new mixer. I lent the old one to my brother and he broke it.\nA:\tYeah I know. I also decided to throw away the old toaster and get a new one. I am also getting a rice cooker and steamer to make some nice steamed fish or veggies.\nB:\tI’m actually thinking of completely refurnishing the kitchen and getting a new stove, oven, dishwasher and trash compacter.\nA:\tThat’s a good idea ! The kitchen will look amazing!\nDaily Life ‐ Telephone Services (C0276)\nA:\tTelco Mobile, how can I help you?\nB:\tYes, I’d like to activate my voice mail service please.\nA:\tCertainly sir, we currently have a special promotion where we include voice mail services, call waiting and also three way calling.\nB:\tSure that sounds great! Are there any other fees?\nA:\tNot at all. No hidden fees or surcharges, it is a flat monthly rate.\nB:\tPerfect. I also wanted to know if there is any call forwarding service? I am usually out of town and would like my calls to be forwarded to a local number.\nA:\tYes of course. We can activate all these services in about an hour.\nThe Office ‐ Presentation Series 3 ‐ Making Comparisons (C0277)\nMr. Ford: Now a key question you might ask yourself is what differentiates the new x420 line with our previous models, and also of course with some of our competitors.\nMr. Ford: In other words what makes the x420 stand out from all the others? This is a key question, and is something I’d like to explore in a little depth.\nFirstly, the x420 has a range of USPs that really make it a cut above the rest.\nMr. Ford: The first thing to mention is that the x420 is the first in a new generation of ultralight laptop computers. It is only 2lbs, which compares very favorably with all our key competitors. In terms of computer performance, for such a light machine it’s very powerful. 4Gb of RAM, with an ultra-fast processor.\nMr. Ford: The most advanced video and sound cards on the market are installed with a crystal-clear 15-inch LCD display. The x420 really stands out as next generation laptop. Compared with our previous x540 range it really is in a league of its own .\nMr. Ford: Now, if we go on to look at projected sales for the x420 we can see that sales revenue for 2010 is expected to hit at least 20 million dollars. Now this is really a conservative estimate.\nMr. Ford: If our marketing campaign is successful I’m confident that we could see a doubling of this figure at the very least. Now please bear in mind that this is only for the first year of production.\nMr. Ford: I’m certain that in the coming three years the x420 will actually overtake all our existing products, both in terms of sales and revenue. Okay, now let’s move on to discuss our marketing concept and look more closely at our key competitors.\nGlobal View ‐ At The Car Dealership (C0278)\nA:\tHi there! I am looking for a new car. I have this old Ford Pinto that I would like to trade in.\nB:\tI see. You are in luck this month because all of our models are on sale! it is a perfect time to buy a new car since it’s the end of the year,\nA:\tPerfect! I like this one.\nB:\tThat is the Ford Focus. A very light but powerful vehicle. It comes with dual side airbags, power steering and power windows, tinted windows and your choice of either automatic or manual transmission.\nA:\tSounds like a good car! How many miles to the gallon?\nB:\tIt is a very fuel efficient vehicle giving you about\n34 miles in the city and 40 on the highway.\nA:\tThat is really convenient. Especially now that fuel prices are so high! What’s under the hood?\nB:\tA very powerful 2.5-liter turbocharged engine, Trust me, this car is fast!\nA:\tNow for the most difficult question. What is the price tag for this lovely vehicle?\nB:\tVery affordable sir. You can take it out of this lot today with 0% down payment and no interest for the first year! You can test drive it now and we can sign the papers when we get back.\nA:\tGreat! Let’s do it!\nGlobal View ‐ Drugs (C0279)\nA:\tHey man, you wanna buy some weed?\nB:\tSome what?\nA:\tWeed! You know? Pot, Ganja, Mary Jane some chronic!\nB:\tOh, umm, no thanks.\nA:\tI also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines.\nB:\tNo, I am ok, really.\nA:\tCome on man! I even got dope and acid! Try some!\nB:\tDo you really have all of these drugs? Where do you get them from?\nA:\tI got my connections! Just tell me what you want and I’ll even give you one ounce for free.\nB:\tSounds good! Let’s see, I want.\nA:\tYeah?\nB:\tI want you to put your hands behind your head! You are under arrest!\nThe Office ‐ Presentation Series 4 ‐ Discussi ng the\nCompetition (C0280)\nMr. Ford: Now, of course, with all this cutting-edge technology there must be a catch, you might ask yourself. I bet the retail price will be too much for most consumers, you might say. Well, you’d be wrong!\nMr. Ford: Yes, of course the x420 is aimed at the luxury market, but if you compare the price of our leading competitors, the x420 represents incredible value for money. At only15,000RMB it is far more affordable and far more attractive than almost every leading brand and model.\nMr. Ford: So, what differentiates us from our competitors? Well, if we compare Orange’s luxury MP40 range then we can really highlight some of the differences.\nMr. Ford: Now, of course Orange has an enviable record for producing revolutionary and top class products, and I must admit the MP40 is a breathtaking machine. However, for most consumers the MP40 is simply far too expensive to consider.\nMr. Ford: Compared with the x420 it is more expensive and there’s no doubt that considering the quality and workmanship that goes into the x420 we really win hands down on value for money.\nMr. Ford: Also, if you compare the after sales service we offer I think we can proudly boast the best customer service facilities in the whole lap-top sector. As opposed to most of our rivals, we guarantee quality, we guarantee service and we guarantee reliability.\nMr. Ford: The questions we must ask ourselves are ” What does the Alpha brand stand for? and also ” How can we set ourselves apart from our competitors? The answer to both of these questions is the same my friends.\nMr. Ford: Alpha stands first and foremost for quality, for excellence and for service. If we always stick to this philosophy then I’m confident that we will really be able to expand our market share significantly. Okay, let me move on now to give you an idea of our marketing campaign for the x420\nThe Weekend ‐ Breaking Up (C0281)\nLydia: Hello?\nMaggie: Hey! Do you want to go out tonight?\nLydia: No, I think I’ll pass. Mark broke up with me. I feel awful.\nMaggie: What?!? What happened? Just last week you were talking about going on vacation together! Lydia: I don’t know what I did wrong. He said he needed some space to figure things out\u0026hellip; He said I didn’t do anything wrong, that I’m a great person\u0026hellip;\njust not the one for him\u0026hellip;\nMaggie: Ugh! That’s so cliche. Mark’s not worth your time, Lydia. You deserve so much better!\nLydia: I know we had hit a rough patch but I had hoped we could work it out next weekend, when we both had some time off\u0026hellip; I think he found someone else. I had been getting suspicious because he had been spending a lot of time with a coworker\u0026hellip;\nMaggie: Whatever. He’s a jerk, forget about him! There are many more fish in the sea.\nLydia: Talk about being clich ′ e, Maggie! But you’re\nright. There’s no use for me to sulk around\u0026hellip; Let’s go out tonight!\nGlobal View ‐ Physics (C0282)\nProf. Brown: Good morning, everybody. Welcome to Physics 101. My name is Ed Brown, and I will be your professor for this semester. Since today is our first class, I wanted to give you an overview of what this course will look like, how you will be graded, and what we will cover this semester.\nMatt: Will we be focusing more on theoretical physics or experimental physics, Professor?\nProf. Brown: This is an introductory course, and my aim is to give you a broad overview of the field of physics. The term “ physics” encompasses many different areas of research and study, and I hope this course will provide you with conceptual understanding of physics, which will prove useful whether or not you choose to further your study in this field.\nProf. Brown: We will begin the course by looking at the fundamental concepts of physics, then by the middle of the semester we will begin exploring the more theoretical side of physics. It is essential that you first have a firm grasp of the fundamentals, so that you can better understand the theoretical concepts when we get to them. Matt: Will we learn about black holes, wormholes, and string theory?\nProf. Brown: We will learn about the general theory of relativity, including black holes. We will also explore developing theories in quantum mechanics, such as string theory. We will discuss some hypothetical features of space-time, like wormholes. Prof. Brown: We will also explore some of the more influential developments in the fields of thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and nuclear physics, all of which have had significant impacts on modern life. Now, I am going to have the TAs pass out the syllabus for this class, so you can see how this course will be graded.\nMatt: Oh man, looks like this isn’t gonna be the easy A I thought it’d be!\nThe Office ‐ Presentation Series 5 ‐ Deferrin g Questions (C0283)\nMr. Ford: Now, as we have already discussed there is a huge untapped market out there both in Asia, in other developing markets, and in the more mature markets for us to push into. Now of course, this represents an enormous challenge with enormous\nrewards for the winners, but for any new product we need a great marketing message and marketing campaign\nMr. Ford: It needs to be directed and focused at our target consumer, and needs to be pitched at exactly the right level. The question we must first address is of course, who is our target consumer and secondly what do they expect from the next generation Alpha lap-top?\nMr. Ford: Let’s first of all tackle the first question. Our target consumer for the x420 is the middle class, white collar worker with an above average income. However, as we mentioned before the total number of computer owners is expanding rapidly and we need to broaden our audience for this product.\nMr. Ford: For example, the x420 is also ideally suited to the younger student sector, who might use laptops both for study and gaming. There is no doubt that.\nAudience Member: Mr. Ford, if I could just interrupt a moment. You say that the computer is suitable for students, but don’t you think the price of the x420 is just too much for most students?\nMr Ford: Well, that’s a fair point. If you don’t mind I’d like to tackle your question a little bit later in the Q and A section. Is that okay? Audience Member: Yes sure.\nMr Ford: Okay, so as I was saying we have an exciting campaign planned for the x420. Firstly, we will have a nationwide television campaign, as well as advertising on radio and also in many computer publications. We also intend to.\nAudience Member: I’m sorry to stop you Mr. Ford, but do you really think that a television campaign is cost effective. I mean, how much is that going to cost?\nMr Ford: Well I don’t have the figures to hand, but I’d be happy to discuss those figures with you after the presentation. Okay let me just go on to talk a little more about the exciting campaign we have in store.\nDaily Life ‐ Tune Up (C0284)\nA:\tWelcome to Al’s Garage. What seems to be the problem?\nB:\tNo problem at all! I am taking a long road trip and I want to make sure my car is in good mechanical condition.\nA:\tVery wise decision. When was the last time you had a tune up?\nB:\tNot that long ago, I think it was four months ago.\nA:\tWe usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers.\nB:\tWhy? I mean, what exactly do you do to a car that you need to check it so often?\nA:\tFirst of all, we change the motor oil and oil filter. If you don’t do this, it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves.\nB:\tI see. What else?\nA:\tWe also check your spark plugs, fuel filter, and other oil levels such as hydraulic fluid. We also check the clutch and brakes to determine when you will need new ones.\nB:\tOk, well, when you put it that way, it doesn’t seem like a waste of time and money.\nA:\tTrust me, regular tune ups will keep your car running smoothly and avoid break downs.\nDaily Life ‐ Handyman (C0285)\nA:\tThe air conditioning is not working! We need to call a handyman before we start to fry in here!\nB:\tDan is on top of that. I think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up.\nA:\tThat would be convenient. They might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring. The circuit breakers keep going out all the time. It’s really annoying!\nB:\tYeah you are right. This office is falling apart! Frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that’s why the parking lot was flooded.\nA:\tI know! I was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day! The handyman definitely has his work cut out for him.\nThe Office ‐ Presentation Series 6 ‐ Addressi ng the Audience (C0286)\nMr. Ford: The campaign that we have in store for the x420 is exciting, imaginative and revolutionary. We have spent two years listening to and responding to feedback from customers and staff alike.\nMr. Ford: I would like to say that without the assistance and support of each and every one of you we really could not have devised this campaign. I’d like to take my hat off and really thank you all for the\nwonderful work you’ve done so far, not only in helping support our marketing efforts, but also in your continuing your commitment to Alpha computers.\nMr. Ford: There’s no doubt in my mind that we have a great workforce here and together we can really push Alpha computers to a whole new level of success.\nMr. Ford: On the subject of the campaign let me ask you all a question. How do we define the perfect lap-top? Is it about affordability, quality, speed, reliability? What do you look for in a consumer? Well, I believe the answer lies in a combination of all of these elements.\nMr. Ford: Our campaign will really hammer home the point that the x420 is a state-ofthe-art laptop for all of your computing needs. With our television campaign we hope to really reach out to a huge audience. Mr. Ford: We have a great ad campaign planned focusing on the fantastic USP’ s of the x420. We have hired one of the best PR companies to work with us on the campaign, and have already completed three separate TV adverts, all focusing on one key feature of the x420.\nMr. Ford: I’m excited to say that today, for the first time, we will unveil to all of you here the first of these advertisements!\nDaily Life ‐ High School Reunion (C0287)\nA:\tI hate coming to high school reunions.\nB:\tIt will be great honey. We will get to see your old classmates and catch up to see how they have been doing.\nA:\tYeah I guess so. Oh look! There is Robert Matthews! Rob!\nC:\tHey Bill! Wow great to see you!\nA:\tLikewise! It’s been a long time! This is my wife\nDorthy.\nC:\tPleasure to meet you. So Bill, how have you been?\nA:\tCan’t complain! We have 2 children who are in college and my business is going well. What about you?\nC:\tAh you know me! I am a dedicated bachelor. I never married although I do have a beautiful daughter with Mary, you remember her? We were high school sweetheart, didn’t really work out between us, but I really can’t complain either.\nA:\tThat’s good. Have you seen Frank? I was hoping he would come tonight.\nC:\tYou didn’t hear? Frank passed away last year.\nA:\tAre you serious?\nC:\tNah! I’m just yanking your chain. He’ll be here soon. I saw him just last week and he told me he would show up.\nThe Weekend ‐ Getting A Tattoo (C0288)\nA:\tI have made up my mind. I am getting a tattoo.\nB:\tReally? Are you sure?\nA:\tYeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back.\nB:\tYeah but, it is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot!\nA:\tReally?\nB:\tOf course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink.\nA:\tOh, I didn’t know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something.\nB:\tI think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, and that the place is hygienic.\nA:\tMaybe I should just get a tongue piercing!\nThe Office ‐ Presentation Series 7 ‐ Handling Technical Problems (C0289)\nMr. Ford: Okay, so if we could dim the lights Jonathan, we can kick-off with the first TV advert. Please note that we are still in the early days with this advert, so it might seem a bit rough round the edges. Okay, so. just need to click this and the advert should pop up on the screen\u0026hellip;\nMr. Ford: Hmmmmmm. Sorry about this. Bear with me me a second. There seems to be a problem with the projector. Let me see. could you lend a hand a second? Jonathan: It looks like the projector is not recognizing the computer. Let me check the connection a second\u0026hellip; Well the connection seems okay, and the computer is running normally.\nMr. Ford: Okay. Sorry guys. Obviously a problem with the system. Let’s just reboot and start over. Let’s see if this resolves the issue.\nJonathan: Right, let’s try again. No, still nothing\nMichael. There might be a technical issue with the projector. I think maybe the projector has overheated. We might need to cool it down for ten minutes and start again. I’ll call IT support to come over right now.\nMr. Ford: Okay guys. Unfortunately technical problems do crop up from time to time, don’t they? But it’s not a huge problem. In the meantime while the IT guys get to work on that I can talk a little bit more about the advertising concept and what we are looking to achieve overall with this campaign.\nThe Weekend ‐ Buying Jewelery (C0290) Shop assistant: Good afternoon, sir, is there anything I can help you with today?\nMark: umm\u0026hellip; yeah! I’m looking for a nice gift to give my girlfriend. Our fifth anniversary’s next Friday. Shop assistant: Well, I would be happy to assist you in choosing the perfect gift for her. Is there anything particular that you have in mind?\nMark: No, not really\u0026hellip; I’m completely at a loss.\nShop assistant: Well, you can give her a set of pearl earrings, or this beautiful heart-shaped pendant. What is her favorite gemstone?\nMark: That purple one. I’m sorry\u0026hellip;I’ve never bought jewelery for anyone and I’m kind of nervous.\nShop assistant: Don’t worry, we specialize in providing our customers a relaxed, pressure-free shopping environment. That stone is an amethyst. We have a range of beautiful amethyst pieces. Take\na\tlook at this bracelet. It’s 18K rose-gold, studded with amethyst and blue topaz. It’s a great statement piece.\nMark: Oh\u0026hellip;wow. That’s really pretty. Jess would love that. But\u0026hellip;I was thinking of something a little more delicate, perhaps a necklace?\nShop assistant: We have this beautiful platinum pendant, or you could also get her a locket. You could also get her a\ntimepiece—it’s both glamorous yet functional. If you\ntell me a little more about your girlfriend, maybe I can help\nyou find something for her. Mark: Jess? Well, she’s very smart, and has a great sense of humor. She’s very feminine\u0026hellip;\nShop assistant: Perhaps you could give her a ring?\nMark: Well\u0026hellip;actually\u0026hellip;I was thinking about asking\nJess to marry me\u0026hellip;I’ve just been so nervous.\nShop\tassistant:\tWell\tsir,\tI\tbelieve\tyour\tfifth\nanniversary is a great time to propose!\nMark: Okay, I’ve decided.

Can I get\nyou anything to drink?\nManny: A Coke for me, please.\nAndrea: I’ll have a Sprite.\nWaitress: Okay, I’ll go get that for you. Are there any questions with the menu? Andrea: Do you use MSG?\nWaitress: No ma’am, we are MSG-free.\nAndrea: Oh man, I haven’t had Chinese food in so long! I want everything! This place has the BEST sesame chicken.\nManny: Yeah, I’ve been craving Chinese for such a long time. I used to get take-out all the time. It’s definitely been a while. Let’s start off with some crab rangoon.\nAndrea: Ooh yeah, that sounds good. I think I’m going to get the sesame chicken with fried rice, a spring roll, and egg drop soup.\nManny: It’s so tempting to order everything on the menu, it all looks so appetizing! I think I’ll get General Tso’s chicken, hot and sour soup, fried wontons, and white rice.\nAndrea: Aren’t you supposed to be on a diet? You should at least get brown rice.\nManny: I don’t think so! I hate brown rice, and I’m so sick of eating healthy all the time. I’ve been eating so much salad I swear I’ve forgotten what meat tastes like! There’s no better remedy than some nice, greasy, calorieladen Chinese food. I might even get an order of broccoli beef!\nAndrea: Gosh, I’m so hungry! Let’s call the waitress over!\nThe Office ‐ Presentation Series 8 ‐ Common Presentation Mistakes (C0292)\nMr. Ford: So as I mentioned previously the campaign advertisement will focus on those key elements that every consumer looks for in a quality laptop: affordability, quality, speed and reliability. We have pulled out all the stops to produce a product that really rivals all our competitors.\nMr. Ford: Actually, just to illustrate my point let me\ngive you an anecdote here. I remember last year I was playing golf with one of our key suppliers. It was a lovely summer afternoon. Anyway, I invited our supplier for a game of golf, and wanted to get his input on the new x420.\nMr. Ford: Actually, I often get together with him for a good game of golf. It really is a wonderful way to relax. To be honest, I’m not that great at golf, but I have improved in the last few years. But the key to golf is practice, practice, practice. I’ve lost my thread. What was I talking about again?\nJonathan: I think you were discussing the campaign advertisement Michael.\nMr. Ford: Yes, excuse me. I’m afraid I got sidetracked there. Yes anyway, the campaign. Well, erm. let me see. Is the projector working yet Jonathan?\nJonathan: No sorry, IT are still fixing it.\nMr. Ford: Ahh okay, erm\u0026hellip; all the information on the campaign is on the PowerPoint. I haven’t actually got my notes with me\u0026hellip;ermlet me see, erm\u0026hellip;..\nAudience Member: Mr. Ford, could you at least tell us the schedule for the campaign? When are the first advertisements scheduled for?\nMr. Ford: That’s a good question. Unfortunately I erm\u0026hellip;don’t have that information on me. I will have to get back to you on that point.\nJonathan: Okay Michael, the projector is fixed. I think we’re ready.\nMr. Ford: Thank goodness. Okay everyone, sorry for the delay. So without further ado the new x420 marketing campaign! Enjoy! oh ermmm. I’m terribly sorry, this is not the advert, this is my golfing holiday in Barbados. I think I must have brought the wrong file. Can we take five?\nAdvanced Media ‐ Cheese Lovers (F0293)\nA:\tHello everyone my name is Laurie and I want to welcome you to this course. We will learn all about one of the oldest yet most delicious foods on this planet; cheese! Let’s get started!\nA:\tCheese is usually categorized intofour types: soft, semi- soft semi-hard and hard. The designation refers to the amount of moisture in the cheese, which directly affects its texture. Making cheese is an ancient practice, dating back thousands of years, and the home cheese maker can usually find recipes for cheese that falls into any of the four categories.\nA:\tSoft cheese includes cottage cheese, cream cheese, ricotta, brie, bleu, roquefort, mozzarella, meunster and similar cheeses. These cheeses generally pair well with fruit or meats, or can be used as breakfast cheeses in an omelette Nor as pasta fillings. They are usually mildly flavored and very high in moisture.\nA:\tAmerican, Colby, co-jack and similar cheeses are inthe semi-soft category. These are slightly stronger in flavor and cover a wide range of uses. Co-jack cheese, a blend of Colby and Monterrey jack is one of the most popular. This allows the sharper flavor of Colby to be combined with the milder jack cheese, and also melts better than plain Colby. Grilled cheese sandwiches often use American cheese, and Mexican cheeses such as Asadero and Queso Fresco are becoming more popular.\nA:\tHard cheeses include Parmesan, Romano, Asiago, Swiss, Gruyere and others. Parmesan and Romano are most familiar as the grated powder used to top spaghetti, but they are also used as accompaniments for fruit, wine, nuts and other appetizer items. Swiss is a popular sandwich cheese and melts well, unlike some other hard cheeses.\nDaily Life ‐ Picking A University (C0294)\nA:\tI’ve never heard of AmLion College. Could you\u0026hellip;\nB:\tOf course sir, let me give you a brief overview. AmLion College is located in the center of New York city. The school covers a wide range of academic subjects; and eighty percent of the courses are transferable to other state universities. And, last year AmLion College was ranked number one in terms of graduate employment.\nA:\tInteresting, and what about the tuition fees, then?\nB:\tYou’ll be looking at somewhere around fifteen thousand US dollars per semester.\nA:\tOkay, well.\nB:\tAnd, did I mention our on-campus housing? Students can stay in our newly renovated dorms for as little as three thousand dollars per month!\nA:\tSounds good. Well. I’ll just grab one of your flyers.\nB:\tSir, you got the wrong flyer. Sir, sir!\nThe Office ‐ Presentation Series 9 ‐ Summar y and\nConclusion (C0295)\nMr. Ford: Right everyone. I apologize that I can’t show you the marketing campaign today, but next week you will all have the opportunity to see if for yourselves, and I have no doubt that you will be impressed. Let me wrap up the presentation by summarising my key points.\nMr. Ford: As I mentioned at the outset, 2010 represents a key year for Alpha computers. The recession is hopefully behind us. It is clear to everyone in the computer industry that demand is booming, especially in the developing markets.\nMr. Ford: If we are to succeed in this ultracompetitive field then we really need to push forward and offer our customers products that meet their needs on all levels. As I hope I have illustrated, the x420 represents the kind of computer that can really satisfy those needs.\nMr. Ford: I gave you an idea of the kind of revenue we expect to hit in 2010 with the new x420 range, and believe me, this is really just the beginning. Once we establish the x420 in the market we have plans to continue to expand our range with ever more revolutionary and impressive products.\nMr. Ford: Alpha computers is dedicated to innovation and improvement. I really see no limit to our potential as long as we stick to the principles I stressed earlier: quality, excellence and service.\nMr. Ford: Before we move on to the Q and A section I’d really like to leave you with a quote that really sums up everything that we’ve discussed today, and hopefully it will provide you with the same inspiration that it gives me.\nMr. Ford: As the great Henry Ford once said ” Quality means doing it right, when no one is looking” Well, in fact our customers are looking; they are looking for\nus to lead the way and to give them the quality that our competitors cannot. We cannot let them down!\nGlobal View ‐ Vegan Or Vegetarian? (C0296)\nA:\tHey Julie, you want to go grab something to eat?\nB:\tSure! What do you feel like having?\nA:\tI really feel like having a big juicy steak!\nB:\tOh. ok. I don’t eat meat, but that’s fine, I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options\nright?\nA:\tI didn’t know you were a vegetarian!\nB:\tI’m not, I am a vegan.\nA:\tA what?\nB:\tA vegan. I don’t eat or use any animal based products. I don’t wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk or anything that comes from an animal. I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don’t eat meat, but still have fish and seafood.\nA:\tWow! That’s interesting! It must be tough!\nB:\tIt’s a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes, but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays, it’s getting a bit less difficult.\nThe Weekend ‐ Ordering At An Italian Restau rant (C0297)\nA:\tGood evening ladies. My name is Josh and I’ll be your server tonight. May I take your order?\nB:\tDo you have any recommendations?\nA:\tWell, I personally like the chicken penne with cream mushroom sauce, but the prawn fettuccine is also very nice.\nB:\tHmm. I’d like to have the grilled chicken, but can\nI have spaghetti instead of penne?\nA:\tOf course, mam. And for you?\nC:\tI\u0026hellip; ah..I’ll have the horse tripe.\nThe Office ‐ Presentation Series 10 ‐ The Q a nd A\nSession (C0298)\nJonathan: Well everyone, I’m sure you’d like to join me in thanking Michael for what was a really inspirational presentation. Sincere thanks\nMichael. Jonathan: Now, I’m sure many of you will be keen to ask some questions, so I’d like to open it up a Q and A session. Please raise your hand if you have any questions at all. Janice, go ahead.\nJanice: Yes thank you Jonathan. I would just like to go back to the comment Mr. Ford made in regards to our competitors, particularly Orange. Now as you know, Orange has established themselves as the market leader in the high-end lap-top market.\nJanice: How does Mr. Ford expect to compete with a company that has such a huge reputation and huge resources?\nMr. Ford: Well Janice, first of all, thanks for a very\ngood question. I think you have hit the nail on the head actually. Orange are the global leaders precisely because of their size and power.\nMr. Ford: But, although we can’t compete in terms of size I do believe we hold an advantage in terms of dedication to customer service. Yes, I admit this is a David and Goliath battle,but don’t forget who won that contest.\nFrank: Ermmm, Mr Ford. Could you elaborate on the actual technical details of the x420 a little more? Mr. Ford: I’d love to but I think we are a little pressed for time right now. However Jonathan has all the technical specs for you on the powerpoint presentation, which you can look over in your own time.\nMarcie: Mr. Ford. One final question. Would you like to join me for a game of golf this Sunday?\nDaily Life ‐ Returning A Product (C0299)\nA:\tHi I would like to return this TV.\nB:\tSure, do you have the receipt?\nA:\tYeah here you go. Actually I also want to return this keyboard.\nB:\tOk, may I ask what is the reason for returning these products?\nA:: The TV flickers a lot when I am watching a movie and at times the image is not very clear.\nB:\tI see, and what about the keyboard?\nA:\tI spilled some coffee on it and now it won’t work.\nB:\tI am sorry sir, but we can only exchange or refund defective products, we cannot take responsibility for misuse or damages.\nA:\tFine! I don’t know why they make these things so delicate anyways.\nDaily Life ‐ Online Dating (C0300)\nA:\tDo you want to hang out tomorrow?\nB:\tOh, I can’t. I have a date!\nA:\tReally? Wow with who?\nB:\tThis girl I’ve been chatting with forthe past couple of months. She’s really cool and she’s driving over here this weekend.\nA:\tWait a minute, you mean you met her online?\nB:\tYeah! I signed up for a website called match. and it is great! You fill in all your details and preferences, like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets. Then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat.\nA:\tThat is kind of weird! What if she is a psycho or something like that?\nB:\tIt’s the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends! I think this is a really cool alternative, especially if you are a bit shy.\nA:\tI guess it does seem logical. I’ll have to check it out!\nThe Weekend ‐ Vampires (C0301)\nA:\tYou want to go tothe movies tonight?\nB:\tSure! What’s playing?\nA:\tThe new Twilight movie!\nB:\tTwilight? As inthe vampire movies? No way I am watching that. I don’t understand why everyone isso excited about these films about vampires. It doesn’t make sense.\nA:\tOf course it does. It’s like a modern tale of Romeo and Juliet. You have a couple that is in love but can’t be together because they are so different. Add in the fact that immortality and super human strengthis really sexy and there you have it! Plus the cast is hip, young people that make the movie even more enticing.\nB:\tI don’t buy into that. I think it’s just a fad. Pretty soon this will pass and everyone will be into werewolves or zombies!\nGlobal View ‐ Phobias (C0302)\nA:\tAre you excited about your trip next month?\nB:\tYes and no. I can’t wait to go to Europe, but at the same time I am terrified.\nA:\tWhy?\nB:\tWell, I have aerophobia. I have a chronic fear of flying.\nA:\tOh really? I have an uncle who is also terrified of flying. It’s not that bad though, I mean, it is pretty scary to be in this big machine flying through the air at seven hundred miles per hour. I actually have arachnophobia.\nB:\tYou’re scared of spiders? I actually have two more phobias. Acrophobia and glossophobia.\nA:\tI guess that explains why you are afraid of flying, but public speaking is not that bad.\nB:\tAre you kidding? When I get on stage, my palms start to sweat, I get really nervous and I can hardly speak.\nA:\tWell, I must confess I am a bit claustrophobic. I\nhate being in an elevator for more than 5 seconds.\nB:\tWe are such weirdos right?\nDaily Life ‐ Mexican Food (C0303)\nA:\tHello sir, welcome to Pistolera restaurant. May I take your order?\nB:\tYes, I would like the chicken cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole.\nA:\tI’m sorry sir, but we ran out of chicken. May I suggest our delicious beef burritos or cheese quesadillas? Both include a side of guacamole and jalapenos.\nB:\tSure I’ll have the burrito.. Do you have nachos?\nA:\tOf course sir. Our nachos come with melted cheese and chili.\nB:\tSounds good.\nA:\tWould you like anything to drink?\nB:\tSure, I’ll have a Corona.\nDaily Life ‐ Neat Freak (C0304)\nA:\tUgg, this bathroom is a pigsty!\nB:\tHelen, why do you keep flushing the toilet? What’s wrong?\nA:\tI just can’t stand it. It’s really gross in here! There’s a stain on the toilet seat, and the floor was wet and slippery. So I cleaned it!\nB:\tYou did what? Helen, I know it’s gross, but I’ve seen many public washrooms that are much worse. Why are you cleaning the counter top? are you out of your mind?\nA:\tI can’t help myself; it’s just so disgusting in here!\nB:\tHelen, this is not like your own bathroom. Just leave it to the cleaners,okay?\nA:\tHang on. I’m just gonna quickly wipe the sink and sweep the floor.\nB:\tYou’re such a neat freak! I’m outta here!\nThe Weekend ‐ Bowling (C0305)\nA:\tAlright, so the first thing that you need to know about bowling is that you should never cross that line where the lane begins.\nB:\tWhy not?\nA:\tBecause they polish and oil it to make the ball slide down. If you step there you will slip and fall.\nA:\tOK, so I got my bowling shoes, my ball, our names on the scorecard, so now, how the heck do I play this?\nA:\tYou throw the ball down the lane and try to knock\ndown all the pins. If you do, that is called a strike. If you don’t knock them all down on the first try, then you get a chance to get the spare. After ten frames, we add up the points and see who has the most. Three hundred is a perfect score, but very hard to get.\nB:\tGot it! OK, I’m gonna give it a go. Oh no! My ball went in the gutter!\nA:\tI told you, its harder than you think. Now let a pro show you how it’s done.\nThe Weekend ‐ Pick Up Lines (C0306)\nA:\tLet’s got out tomorrow night. We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend.\nB:\tI don’t think that’s a good idea. I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation.\nA:\tMaybe you just need a few pick up lines,you know, break the ice.\nB:\tPick up lines don’t work!\nA:\tCome on! You can just walk up to a girl and say:\n“If you were a booger I’d pick you first.”\nB:\tWhat? Come on! That’s just lame! No girl would fall for that!\nA:\tFine, then you can say: “So there you are! I’ve been looking all over for YOU, the woman of my dreams!”\nB:\tThat’s a good one! I think that’s pretty funny.\nA:\tYeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink.\nB:\tOk, how does this sound: “I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes.”\nA:\tNice! Let’s go!\nThe Office ‐ Small Talk Series ‐ Showing Int erest\n(C0307)\nTina: Hey Michelle, this is my friend James.

I know you have never had Indian food, so I thought you might want to try.\nA:\tThat sounds great! I am craving some type of beef dish.\nB:\tWell, Indian cuisine actually doesn’t serve beef.\nYou see, cows are a sacred animal, a very important element inthe Hindu religion, so beef is not eaten.\nA:\tI see, so what are we having? Chicken?\nB:\tThere are many amazing dishes to choose from. We can havesome chicken tikka masalawhich is an amazing curry. It’s a bit spicy, but I think you can handle it.\nA:\tSounds good! I have always heard that Indian spices give a rich flavor to food.\nB:\tYeah. Also, we can have some Naan bread which is baked in a tandoori oven. Since you don’t use any utensils to eat, you can use this bread to scoop upthe curry or rice.\nA:\tWhat about veggies?\nB:\tThey have a good variety of vegetable based dishes like palak paneer, vegetable samosas or Daal.\nA:\tIt all sounds exquisite! I can’t wait!\nThe Office ‐ Small Talk 2 (C0310)\nJames: So Michelle, let me introduce you to Maria.\nShe’s my colleague from Brazil. Maria, this is\nMichelle.\nMaria: Hi Michelle.

Actually, there’s a great Brazilian restaurant I recommend. I mean, the food is delicious butthe service isn’t so good. I often like to get together with friends and have a great barbecue there.\nJames: We should go together some time.\nMichelle: Wonderful idea!

Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck. Susan: You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair.\nEmily: Well, this is my first paycheck here inthe States and there are a few things I don’t understand. First off, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan?\nSusan: OK, let’s start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. Emily: Yes, that’s easy enough to understand. Susan: Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It’s your federal income tax. And then there’s Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work.\nEmily: All right, I see. So the Medicare isn’t actually a health insurance I can use now.\nSusan: That’s right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There’s the state income tax, and then this SUI SDItax you were asking about\nis paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it’s a pretty small quantity that they take.\nEmily: Yeah, I don’t mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes – one at a state level and one at a federal level?\nSusan: That’s right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead.\nEmily: I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401(K) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan.\nSusan: No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody’s net pay is as high as they’d like. I can understand why you’d want some explanation.\nEmily: Yeah, I guess it’s the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later!\nGlobal View ‐ Allergies (C0318)\nJim: Argh\u0026hellip;I feel terrible, I keep sneezing and my eyes are all watery, what’s wrong with me?\nTom: Wow, you’re not dying are you, it looks like you have a cold, you should take some medicine.\nJim: I don’t think it’s a cold, I feel fine if I move a few feet away from my desk.\nTom: Maybe we should put you into quarantine ha ha, jokes aside, I think you might have an allergy.

Global View - The Night Before Christmas (C0337)\nIt was the night before Christmas, when all through the house\nNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse; The stockings were hung bythe chimney with care, In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there; The children were nestled all snug in their beds, And mama in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap, Had just settled down for a long winter’s nap, When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.\nAway to the window I flew like a flash, Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.\nThe moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below, When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer, With a little old driver, so lively and quick,\nI knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.\nMore rapid than eagles his coursers they came, And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name;\n” Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer and\nVixen!\nOn, Comet! on Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall! Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!\nAs dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too. And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof.\nThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head, and was turning around, Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;\nA bundle of toys he had flung on his back,\nAnd he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes – how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!\nHis cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, Andthe beard of his chin was as white as the snow; The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, Andthe smoke it encircled his head like a wreath; He had a broad face and a little round belly,\nThat shook, when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,\nSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;\nHe spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, And filled allthe thestockings; then turned with a jerk,\nAnd laying his finger aside of his nose, And giving a nod, upthe chimney he rose;\nHe sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,\n” Christmas to all, and to all a good-night.\nDaily Life - Having Leftovers (C0338)\nA:\tWhat’s for dinner?\nB:\tLeftovers.\nA:\tWhat?

So how long do we bake it for?\nA:\tWe can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes.\nThen we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.\nB:\tWow! This was a lot easier than I thought!\nGlobal View - At The Library (C0342)\nA:\tWow! Look at all these books! I bet I can find a book about anything here!\nB:\tShhh!! Please keep your voice down.

Cancel the lobster and give me one of the same please.\nC:\tVery well sir. Anything to drink?\nA:\tCan we get a bottle of your house white wine please?\nC:\tSuperb choice. I will be back shortly with the wine.\nGlobal View - Booking A Hotel Room (C0344)\nA:\tMadison Suites, how may I help you?\nB:\tYes, I’m calling from Mexico.

I will be there for seven nights.\nB:\tWe have a junior single suite or a superior double suite available for those dates.\nA:\tWhat’s the difference?\nB:\tThe junior suite is smaller and has one twin bed, while the superior suite has a double bed and mini-bar.\nA:\tOK, I would like to reserve the superior suite. Is breakfast included?\nB:\tYes, a buffet breakfast is served every morning. I will need your name and your credit card details in order to complete the reservation.\nA:\tSure, my credit card number is\u0026hellip;\nDaily Life - Working Out (C0345)\nA:\tDo you want to go catch a movie tonight?\nB:\tI can’t, I have to go tothe gym.\nA:\tCome on! You can go tomorrow, just skip it today.\nIt’s not as if you are gonna get in trouble!\nB:\tActually I will! I am working out with a personal trainer that gets on my case if I don’t go. I like it, because it makes me feel more obligated to go and get healthy.\nA:\tThat’s cool, does your personal trainer basically teach you how to work out?\nB:\tYeah. He makes a work put plan depending on the areas I want to work on, or the muscles I want to build. Like for example in order to get better muscle tone in my abs, pecs and biceps, he makes me work out with free weights. Then for my quads, calves and hamstrings, I do leg lifts or squats.\nA:\tSounds like you are really getting in shape!\nGlobal View - All About Wines (C0346) Salesperson: Hello there, welcome to WineWorld. Let me know if I can help you out at all.\nCustomer: Um, yes, please, I could really use some help. I’m going over to my boss’ house for dinner tonight and don’t know what kind of wine I should bring.\nSalesperson: OK, do you know what kind of food will be served?\nCustomer: Well, his wife is Japanese. He said she makes really good sushi.\nSalesperson: Hmm, that’s a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine.\nWell, let’s see. have to be a white wine, of course. Customer: Why? Wouldn’t a red wine go well with sushi?\nSalesperson: No, I don’t think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish. Customer: I see. So should I get a bottle of\nChardonnay? That’s a white wine, right?\nSalesperson: Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but\nI’m not sure it’d be your best bet.\nChardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I’d suggest that you go for something\nbrighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand.\nCustomer: Sauvignon Blanc? What’s that?\nSalesperson: That’s another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay.\nCustomer: Let’s see. The label says it’s\ngot ”attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a bonedry finish. Serve chilled.” Oh, no, how long will it take to chill the wine? I’m on my way to the dinner now.\nSalesperson: It’s OK, don’t worry, we’ll just choose a wine from the cooler. We don’t have quite as extensive a selection over here,\nbut\u0026hellip;this Rhone Valley white would be lovely. Customer: All right. What varietal is that? Salesperson: Well, this is a French wine, so they don’t always specify the varietal on the label.\nThe French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine.\nThis wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier,\nI’d guess.\nCustomer: And you think this is a good wine? Salesperson: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It’s not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it’s more approachable. It’s light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.\nCustomer: Perfect! I’ll take it!\nGlobal View - Immigration and Customs (C0347)\nA:\tGood afternoon, passport and arrival card please.\nB:\tHere you are.\nA:\tWhere are you coming from?\nB:\tChina.\nA:\tIs this your country of birth or residence.\nB:\tI just work there.\nA:\tWhat is the purpose of your visit to the United States?\nB:\tI’m here on vacation.\nA:\tHow long do you plan to stay in the United States?\nB:\tAlmost three weeks.\nA:\tSir, you didn’t fill out the information on your arrival card of where you will be staying.\nB:\tOh, I’m sorry, but there are a couple of different places I will travel to within the United States, so I wasn’t sure what to put.\nA:\tYou must specify an address of the place where you will spend most of your time.\nB:\tOk, here you are.\nA:\tDo you have enough means to support yourself while you are here?\nB:\tYes. I have some travellers cheques and two credit cards.\nA:\tVery good. Do you have anything to declare?\nB:\tNope. I only have my clothes and camera!\nA:\tVery well sir, welcome to the United States, enjoy your visit.\nThe Weekend - Talking About Skincare (C0348)\nA:\tYou want to go get a facial with me today?\nB:\tDude, what are you talking about? Only girls do that.\nA:\tNot at all, guys also get facials, manicures and pedicures. There is nothing wrong with looking after your skin and looking good.\nB:\tTrue. So what do they do to you at your beauty spa?\nA:\tWell, first they exfoliate my face, getting rid of all the dead skin. Then I get a face mask with nutrients that keep my skin healthy and young. Afterwards, they apply some moisturizer and you leave feeling like a million bucks.\nB:\tThat doesn’t really sound like something I would be interested in. In any case, I just wash my face every night and use sunscreen during the day.\nA:\tWell you should come with me one day, I’m sure you’ll love it.\nB:\tUh\u0026hellip; no.\nGlobal View - Chinese Medicine (C0349)\nA:\tWhat’s wrong?\nB:\tI have a headache. These past few days I’ve been living off painkillers. Man, I feel like my head is going to explode.\nA:\tYou should get acupuncture treatment. My mom was always having headache issues and it was acupuncture that cured her.\nB:\tThe results are too slow. On top of that, just the thought of smoking needles poking into my flesh frightens me.\nA:\tThey don’t just randomly stick you, they find your pressure points. The heat allows the body to immediately respond to the treatment, restoring the body’s ”chi”.\nB:\tBut I get scared the moment I see a needle. How could I stand having needles in my body for hours on end?\nA:\tThe needles are very thin, and as long as the doctor’s technique is good, and the patient himself is relaxed, it won’t hurt–on the contrary it will actually alleviate pain. Now there are high-tech\nneedles that are micro thin; they don’t hurt at all.\nHowever, if you are really scared of acupuncture, scraping or cupping are also options.\nB:\tScraping is too terrifying. When they finish\nscrapping, your body is all red, as if you were just tortured.\nCupping is the same, your body ends up with red circles all over it–looks like someone beat you up.\nA:\tThis only signifies that the toxins have left the body. Actually, there is only discomfort during the treatment process. Once it’s over you feel very comfortable.\nB:\tChinese medicine is strange. The patients are already\nill, and then the doctor makes them suffer more.\nA:\tThis is the only way to get at the problem. Anyway, if you want to relieve the pain, You are just going to have to be tough and do it.\nB:\tForget it. I don’t want to inflict any more pain on myself. In a little while I’ll go and buy some more painkillers and take a nap.\nDaily Life - Talking About Relatives (C0350)\nA:\tWhat are you doing this weekend?\nB:\tMy brother in law is having a small get together at his house and he invited me.\nA:\tIs it a family thing or just friends?\nB:\tA bit of both. Some cousins, aunts and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.\nA:\tIs your great uncle Rick going to be there? He is really funny.\nB:\tYeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife.\nA:\tYou mean your sister?\nB:\tNo, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he is my grandmother’s brother.\nA:\tYou lost me.\nB:\tI’ll explain later, let’s go.\nDaily Life - Vaccinations (C0351)\nA:\tHello Mrs. Parker, how have you been?\nB:\tHello Dr. Peters. Just fine thank you. Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.\nA:\tVery well. Let’s see, according to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his Polio, Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots. He is 14 months old, so he is due for Hepatitis A, Chickenpox and Measles shots.\nB:\tWhat about Rubella and Mumps?\nA:\tWell, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest.\nB:\tOk great. Doctor, I think I also may need a Tetanus booster. Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago!\nA:\tWe will check our records and I’ll have the nurse administer the booster as well. Now, please hold\nRicky’s arm tight, this may sting a little.\nGlobal View - The 7 Wonders Of The World (C0352)\nA:\tHave you seen this news article? Apparently an organization has made a list to name the new seven wonders of the world and people could vote for them online.\nB:\tWow, that’s really interesting. So who won?\nA:\tWell, the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal in India.\nB:\tI’ve been there! It really is an amazing work of architecture and art. The entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb, the walls are covered with gems and emeralds!\nA:\tCool! Also amongst the winners is Petra, in Jordan,\nMachu Picchu in Peru and the pyramid in Chichenitza in Mexico.\nB:\tWait a minute! It also says that the Christ\nRedeemer statue in Brazil and the Colosseum in Rome are wonders. I would love to go to Italy and see the Colosseum, stand in the middle like a gladiator!\nA:\tWell, let’s see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year.\nB:\tGood idea!\nGlobal View - College Life (C0353)\nA:\tHey, Jordan, is that you? Long time no see!\nB:\tOh, hey, no kidding! I haven’t seen you since orientation three months ago! So how’ve you been?\nSettling into college life OK?\nA:\tYeah, I think so! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha, so I’m living at the frat house now.\nB:\tOh, so you’re a frat boy now, huh?\nA:\tYeah, yeah, I know, it’s totally clich ´ e, but really, I think it’s been a good decision. I’ve got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys.\nWhat about you? What have you been up to?\nB:\tNot much. I’m still living at home and commuting to school. I ended up dropping that metalworking class I was so excited about. It just wasn’t as interesting as I’d hoped. The guidance counselor suggested that I focus on my prerequisite courses so that I can make sure the credits count.\nA:\tThat sounds smart. . . but kind of boring.\nB:\tYeah, it is, a little bit. I joined the Great Outdoors\nClub, though, which has been a lot of fun. We’ve gone on two camping trips already, and I’ve made some good friends.\nA:\tThat’s cool. Hey, so have you decided on your\nmajor yet?\nB: Definitely pre-med. What about you?\nA:\tI still have no clue. . . but we don’t have to declare a major ‘til our sophomore year, so I’ve got time! Oops, I’m late for class. Gotta run!\nB:\tOK, take care! Hey, nice running into you!\nA: Yeah, you too!\nGlobal View - Homeschooling (C0354)\nA:\tI think we should home school our children when we decide to have kids.\nB:\tWhat? Why?\nA:\tWell, our public schools here are not very good and private school are just too expensive. I have been reading up on home schooling and it has a lot of advantages.\nB:\tLike what? I think that by doing something like that we would be isolating our children from social interaction.\nA:\tWell, first of all, I would be able to teach them everything they learn in school in a more relaxed and fun way. I also think that having a one-on-one class is much better since you can focus more on his or her strengths or weaknesses.\nB:\tI think neither your parents or mine would agree to such an idea.\nA:\tI will bring it up over Sunday brunch.\nB:\tGood luck with that!\nDaily Life - Lending Money (C0355)\nA:\tCan I borrow five bucks?\nB:\tNo!\nA:\tCome on! I’ll pay you back on Tuesday.\nB:\tLast time I lent you money, you never paid me back.\nA:\tI promise if you lend me five dollars today, I will repay you in full next week.\nB:\tOk, but I’m taking your skateboard as collateral.\nA:\tFine! I can’t believe you don’t trust me.\nB:\tIt’s nothing personal, just business.\nDaily Life - Coins and Money (C0356)\nA:\tHelp me organize these coins.\nB:\tThat’s a lot of money! What did you do? Break the piggy bank?\nA:\tYeah, I’m gonna go to the bank and change it for bills, but first I have to separate them into little piles.\nB:\tOk, I’ll find all the quarters and dimes while you sort the nickels and pennies.\nA:\tGreat, then we can add everything up and take it to the bank.\nB:\tI found some coins that are not from here.\nA:\tOh yeah, those are from my trip to London. I have\na couple of different pence, but in all it won’t add up to one pound.\nB:\tAre you sure the bank will change these coins for you?\nA:\tHopefully!\nDaily Life - Making A Dinner Reservation (C0357)\nA:\tBruno Bistro, how may I help you?\nB:\tYes hello, I would like to make a reservation please.\nA:\tCertainly sir, For which day and time please?\nB:\tTonight at seven.\nA:\tI’m sorry sir, but we are fully booked tonight until eight.\nB:\tIn that case, eight o’clock is fine.\nA:\tVery well, and how many people will attend tonight?\nB:\tFour people.\nA:\tLastly, may I please know what name I should make the reservation under?\nA:\tMark.\nDaily Life - Text Me (C0358)\nA:\tWhy didn’t you text me last night?\nB:\tWhat? I sent you three or four messages!\nA:\tI didn’t get any of them. I was waiting for you to text me the address of where the party was and I never got your message.\nB:\tWhy didn’t you just call? I hate sending SMS messages.\nA:\tWell, because I didn’t have any credit on my phone. I used it all up this month.\nB:\tI thought you had an unlimited SMS plan?\nA:\tI do, but if I don’t have any credit in my phone, it won’t let me call or send messages.\nB:\tNo wonder you didn’t get my texts!\nGlobal View - E-mail Scam (C0359)\nA:\tI got an urgent email from Tom! He says he is in London and got robbed and needs us to wire him some money for his hotel.\nB:\tWhat? That sounds really dodgy tome.\nA:\tNo way, Tom is an honest person, he wouldn’t lie tome.\nB:\tNo I mean, it seems like someone may have hacked his email account and sent that out. I mean think about it, why would he email you instead of calling you.\nA:\tDo you really think someone is trying to scam people into sending money?\nB:\tFor sure! There are so many con artists out there, you never really know.\nGlobal View - Urban Legends (C0360)\nA:\tHave you read all these crazy things that are going on around the world?\nB:\tWhat do you mean?\nA:\tI was reading about how some people get tricked or drugged in their hotel rooms and have their organs removed! Then they are sold on the black market.\nB:\tDon’t tell me you actually believe all that? Don’t be so gullible, they are just urban legends. They are just stories people make up to scare you.\nA:\tWell, I was also reading about how some popular songs have subliminal or even satanic messages if you play them backwards! Can you believe that?\nB:\tYou really think an artist or songwriter is going to go through the trouble of putting subliminal or satanic messages in a song? Don’t be so naive!\nA:\tWell maybe you are right, but how about the story of how KFC has rows of headless chickens which are super grown in order to get bigger chickens faster!\nB:\tSounds a bit too far fetched to be true don’t you think?\nDaily Life - Fast Food (C0361)\nA:\tI’m hungry, let’s order up something to eat.\nB:\tOk, maybe we can order a soup and a salad from the restaurant down the street.\nA:\tI was thinking of getting a hamburger, fries and a chocolate sundae.\nB:\tYou eat too much junk food. That sort of stuff clogs up your arteries and is very high in cholesterol.\nA:\tWell I never seem to gain weight so I don’t mind.\nB:\tIt’s not only about getting fat or not, it’s about being healthy. You could really have some health problems later on.\nA:\tHow about pizza or maybe some fried chicken!\nBetter yet, let’s order some hot dogs!\nB:\tYou are a lost cause.\nDaily Life - What Mood Are You In? (C0362)\nA:\tAre you ok? You seem a bit anxious.\nB:\tYeah I’m OK, I have been having a lot of mood swings lately. I think it has to do with the pills my doctor prescribed that are causing chaos on my hormones.\nA:\tSo you mean you feel ecstatic one minute and then blue the next?\nB:\tYeah, it’s weird. For example just this morning\nI was feeling detached and lonely, even though there was really no reason to feel that way.\nA:\tWell, maybe your mood will swing positively and you will feel confident, brave and hopeful!\n100\nB: I hope you are right.\nDaily Life - Living With Your Parents (C0363)\nA:\tWhy did your girlfriend break up with you?\nB:\tI don’t know, she said she was tired of me not manning up and being more independent, which I think is all a bunch of crap.\nA:\tWell, you still live with your parents, so she does have a point.\nB:\tWhat do you mean? Lots of people live with their parents, especially when rent is so expensive and the slump in the economy.\nA:\tYeah, but you are almost forty! Plus, you make good money so there is really no excuse. It’s simply because you are a momma’s boy.\nB:\tWhatever dude, I have everything I need, why would I move out! Have a great roof over my head, my mom does my laundry and cooks for me, what else could a guy ask for!\nA:\tLet’s agree to disagree.\nDaily Life - Hiring Help (C0364)\nA:\tCan you help me write a newspaper ad?\nB:\tSure, what are you looking to buy or sell?\nA:\tActually, I want to hire someone to help me around the house.\nB:\tOh, you want to get a maid?\nA:\tWell, I think it’s better if you call her a cleaning lady or domestic help.\nB:\tOk, so what do you want her to do?\nA:\tWell, let’s see. I want her to come in three times a week for a couple of hours to clean the kitchen, bathroom and maybe do some cooking.\nB:\tGot it. And how much do you offer per month?\nA:\tI would pay her hourly, I don’t know what the going rate is though.\nB:\tI know for sure it’s more than minimum wage but maybe you should just negotiate with the person that answers the ad.\nA:\tGreat! Thanks for your help!\nDaily Life - Household Chores (C0365)\nA:\tKevin, what is this mess? It looks like a pigsty in here! Clean this up!\nB:\tOk dad, I will do it in a minute, let me just finish this level of this game.\nA:\tNo, I said now! Plus, you are grounded, you’re not allowed to play video games. I want you to make your bed, do the laundry and then come downstairs and sweep the floors.\nB:\tThat’s so unfair!\nA:\tYou have to pull your weight around here young man. My house, my rules.\nB:\tBut I already mopped the floors, dusted the furniture and vacuumed the rugs!\nA:\tThat’s great, but you still have work to do, so get to it.\n","date":"2020-02-29","permalink":"https://yang419.com/englishpod/","summary":"听力文本 Elementary ‐ Difficult Customer (B0001) A: Good evening.

序，整个排序过程可以递归进行，以此达到整个数据变成有序序列\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43  package com.yang.sort.quicksort; import

//把当前遍历的数组放入指定数组中  temp[ys][counts[ys]] = arr[j]; //记录数量  counts[ys]++; } //记录个数  int index = 0; //把数字取出来  for (int k = 0; k \u0026lt; counts.length; k++) { //记录的数组中当前余数记录的数量不为0  if (counts[k]!=0){ //循环取出元素  for (int l = 0; l \u0026lt; counts[k]; l++) { //取出元素  arr[index] = temp[k][l]; index++; } //把数量置为0  counts[k]=0; } } } } }   递归(Recursion) 概念 简单的说: 递归就是方法自己调用自己,每次调用时传入不同的变量.递归有助于编程者解决复杂的问题,同时\n可以让代码变得简洁。\n递归要遵守的规则  执行一个方法时，就创建一个新的受保护的独立空间(栈空间) 方法的局部变量是独立的，不会相互影响,比如n变量 如果方法中使用的是引用类型变量(比如数组)，就会共享该引用类型的数据. 递归必须向退出递归的条件逼近，否则就是无限递归,出现StackOverflowError，死龟了:) 当一个方法执行完毕，或者遇到return，就会返回，遵守谁调用，就将结果返回给谁，同时当方法执行完毕或者返回时，该方法也就执行完毕

来源：https://www.douban.com/note/645895227/\n按：前几日收到一位学生的《政府论》读书笔记，其中问题相当严重，所以特地花了许多时间，从头到尾每一段都注满了红色旁批。我当然知道并非每一位学生都会从事学术研究，学术并不是人生的惟一选择。但是，假定这位学生未来有志于从事学术研究，我希望我的批改能够烧旺这位学生的学术小火苗。而且，我也注意到，豆瓣上有不少读书笔记也存在着类似问题，所以贴出来供需要的人参考。为了保护隐私，隐去了这位学生的姓名和读书笔记内容。\nXX：\n你好！邮件收悉。不知你的专业是什么？我相信你肯定花了许多工夫来阅读《政府论》。不过，如果你的专业跟《政府论》的主题密切相关的，不得不说，你可能还需要重读一遍《政府论》。当然，我也会对你提出更加苛刻的要求。如果你的专业与此无关，确实情有可原。我的意见请见附件，这是我在假定你的专业与此无关的情况下提出的建议。\n另外，关于读书笔记，向你提几个小建议，仅供参考。\n第一，建议勾勒该书的核心框架：作者提出了什么问题？对这个问题是如何回答的？回答分为几个主要步骤？每个步骤的核心观点和核心论据是什么？作者的结论是什么？\n第二，建议每个要点都分成一、二、三……来讨论，每个小点可以再细分小点。但是分点不是为了分而分，每个要点之间都是要有逻辑联系的。（这就是你的读书笔记中所说的“一步一步论证”。）\n第三，建议列出该书的版本信息，并在每个核心观点之后都注明页码，以方便日后写作时引用。要不然，合上书本，你可能就找不到这些观点的出处了，尤其是经过若干年之后。\n第四，不要抒发跟所读著作无关或者不痛不痒的感想，这些都是无用的空话。如果日后写作论文，其中一个最基本的要求就是没有一句废话。感想就是典型的废话。完全删除，根本不影响你的行文。\n或许你会觉得我跟你提出的意见太过严苛。不过，我的目的并不是要把你批得体无完肤，而是希望指出你可能的不足与可供改进的空间，并为此提出如何改进的建议。我也希望你不要气馁，因为你犯过的错误，我都犯过，并为此付出了惨痛的代价。我的第一篇论文被我导师批得一塌糊涂，但是这是我的学术生涯中最宝贵的财富。从那之后，我再也没有犯过类似的错误。而且，我不会因为你的这篇读书笔记而判定你不合格，或者给你比较低的分数。我不在意你一开始写成怎样，我在意的是你最后能写成怎样。所以，我看重的是你的成长过程。假如你经过一年后，你的读书笔记非常出色，我照样会给你最高的分数。\n……\n华灵\n（关于经典阅读的问题，请参考：读不懂经典，怎么办？）\n以下分享一篇个人读书笔记，以抛砖引玉： （说明：中国思想史不是我的专业领域，所以我的把握未必到位。另外，豆瓣无法呈现word里的格式，所以显得有点乱。不过，大体框架还是可以呈现出来的。我的读书笔记方法基本就是分点，再分点，继续分点……我的写作习惯是，先列好提纲，再填充提纲中的具体内容。而我的读书笔记方法是，把作者的具体内容，还原为原始提纲。这样，结构清晰，一目了然。当然，这只是个人喜好。有些人喜欢写成小文章，我还以前还喜欢画图表，现在则喜欢拉结构框架。只要按照让自己明白的方式，把作者的结构框架梳理清楚即可，没有定法，仅供参考。另外，这篇读书笔记删去了我的个人评论，仅仅把梳理该文核心框架的内容发出来了。个人认为，读书笔记的最高境界是，既梳理核心框架，又提出批评性观点。一言以蔽之，梳理+评论。）\n萧高彦：《张佛泉自由主义中的宪政与民主》，载许纪霖、刘擎主编：《多维视野中的个人、国家与天下认同》，上海：华东师范大学出版社，2013年。\n萧高彦《张佛泉自由主义中的宪政与民主》读书笔记\n核心观点： 1、张佛泉的《自由与人权》所建构的是“人权清单式自由主义”，而这种人权清单式自由主义蕴含着共和主义潜流。 2、张佛泉的核心框架：作为自然权利的人权清单→政治契约→作为实在权利的人权清单+民主国家 3、萧高彦的两种自由概念（萧高彦认为早于伯林约五年）：（1）“诸权利即诸自由”；（2）内在自由\n一、\t本文的目标：分析《自由与人权》\n二、\t“诸权利即诸自由”：张佛泉自由主义的核心观念（169—175）\n（一）\t张佛泉的两种自由（萧高彦认为，“早于柏林约五年，张氏便已提出两种不同自由观念的重大区别。”171）\n1、自由即权利——政治保障：《自由与人权》的主题是第一种自由（171） （1）人权的性质：八大特点（173）（张佛泉的人权清单不见于《自由与人权》中，但列于同期论文《自由与民主的起码意义》中） （2）国家既不是权利的来源，也不是权利的主体（174） 2、内在自由——内心状态：“它不只代表‘自由意志’。凡是自发的、主动的、内心的自由生活或理论，都可说包括在后一种指称之下。”（171）\n三、\t自由的“器用化”：民主邦国的宪法（175—180）\n（一）\t张佛泉关于人权与国家关系的三大命题 1、现代国家由政治契约形成：剔除社会契约的空想成分 （1）权利是国家的原始起点 （2）人权清单是国家主权所在 2、国家与社会关系：国家是强制性组合，而社会是非强制性组合。因此，国家是法制组合（legal association），亦即国家就是法律，法律之外属于社会的范畴（176） 3、人权清单是国家与社会的关口：权利的二重性——一方面，它是国家成立之前的自然权利；另一方面，它是国家成立之后的实在权利（176—177）\n（二）\t人权器用化的两项原则 1、阻碍之阻碍的原则（principle of the hindrance of hindrance）：源自康德（177—178） 2、不妨他人之自由始为自由原则（178）\n（三）\t民主政治作为权利的器用化 1、民主的最高准备不是多数决议，而是人权（179） 2、民主不是政体。因为具有主权地位的是人权清单与宪法（179） 3、民主是自由的器用化：自由是目的，民主是方法（180）\n（四）\t宪政自由主义与“政治契约”的观念（180—184） 1、张佛泉的核心框架：“具体而言，张佛泉的概念架构，是社会中‘前政治’具有诸人权的个人，通过政治契约，缔造了以人权清单及宪法具有最高地位的现代邦国。”（181） 2、张佛泉受到Ernest Barker’s Principles of Social and Political Theory的影响（182—183）\n（五）\t民主的第二面向：共和民主的潜流（184—189） 1、《自由与人权》的政治契约所面临的两个困难（184） （1）政治契约需要何种程度社会成员的同意？张佛泉认为需要一致同意，但是他并没有给出充分的论证。 （2）前一个困难的解决是否预设更积极的民主概念？ 2、萧高彦认为张佛泉的自由主义中蕴含着更积极的民主观念，即共和民主——民主生活作为集体的共同创造+民主程序用来审议重大政治事务（187—188）\n四、\t结语：自由与民主之价值共构（188—189）\n本文结论：张佛泉的《自由与人权》所建构的是“人权清单式自由主义”，而这种人权清单式自由主义蕴含着共和主义潜流。（188）\nSteven Lukes, “Must Pluralists be

i.\tDistinction between pluralism and relativism ii.\tVico and Herder are not relativists: 他认为自己以前把他们归为相对主义者是错误的，实际上他所言的相对主义指的是objective pluralism\nIII.\tLukes’ View: i.\tBerlin outlines three

that whole outlooks are determined by forces of which people are unaware B.\tPluralism holds that cultural differences are bridgeable, but relativism does not C.\tPluralism holds that values are objective, but relativism does not. ii.\tBerlin needs more to defend against relativism Two senses of relativism: A.\tRelativism of understanding: mutual understanding is impossible – both berlin and Momigliano successfully reject it B.\tRelativism of practical judgment: no trans-cultural criteria for deciding evaluative questions – Berlin’s pluralism needs protection against

h.damage\u0026lt;50);\n​\t}\n};\n接着调用filter，传递这个checker进去进行判断，这种方式就很像通过Collections.sort在对一个Hero集合排序，需要传一个Comparator 的匿名类对象进去一样。`\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26

使用lambda筛选出\nfilter(heros,(h)-\u0026gt;h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50);\n同样是调用filter方法，从上一步的传递匿名类对象，变成了传递一个Lambda表达式进去\nh-\u0026gt;h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  import charactor.Hero; public class TestLamdba { public static void main(String[] args) { Random r = new Random();

if(checker.test(hero)) System.out.print(hero); } } }   从匿名类演变成Lambda表达式  匿名类正常写法  1 2 3 4 5  HeroChecker c1 = new HeroChecker() { public boolean test(Hero h) { return (h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50); } };   把外面的壳子去掉 只保留方法参数和方法体 参数和方法体之间加上符号 -\u0026gt;  1 2 3 4  HeroChecker c2 = (Hero h) -\u0026gt;{ return h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50; };   把return和{}去掉  1  HeroChecker c3 = (Hero h) -\u0026gt;h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50;   把 参数类型和圆括号去掉(只有一个参数的时候，才可以去掉圆括号)  1  HeroChecker c4 = h -\u0026gt;h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50;   把c4作为参数传递进去  1  filter(heros,c4);   直接把表达式传递进去  1  filter(heros, h -\u0026gt; h.hp \u0026gt; 100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage \u0026lt; 50);   匿名方法 与匿名类 概念相比较， Lambda 其实就是匿名方法，这是一种把方法作为参数进行传递的编程思想。\n虽然代码是这么写\n1  filter(heros, h -\u0026gt; h.hp \u0026gt; 100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage \u0026lt; 50);   但是，Java会在背后，悄悄的，把这些都还原成匿名类方式 。 引入Lambda表达式，会使得代码更加紧凑，而不是各种接口和匿名类到处飞。\n弊端 Lambda表达式虽然带来了代码的简洁，但是也有其局限性。 \\1. 可读性差，与啰嗦的但是清晰的匿名类代码结构比较起来，Lambda表达式一旦变得比较长，就难以理解 \\2. 不便于调试，很难在Lambda表达式中增加调试信息，比如日志 \\3. 版本支持，Lambda表达式在JDK8版本中才开始支持，如果系统使用的是以前的版本，考虑系统的稳定性等原因，而不愿意升级，那么就无法使用。\nLambda比较适合用在简短的业务代码中，并不适合用在复杂的系统中，会加大维护成本。\n方法引用 引用静态方法 首先为TestLambda添加一个静态方法：\n1 2 3  public static boolean testHero(Hero h) { return h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50; }   lambda\n1  filter(heros, h-\u0026gt;h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50);   在Lambda表达式中调用这个静态方法：\n1  filter(heros, h -\u0026gt; TestLambda.testHero(h) );   还可以写成\n1  filter(heros, TestLambda::testHero);   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.Random; import charactor.Hero; public class TestLambda { public static void main(String[] args) { Random r = new Random(); List\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt; heros = new ArrayList\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt;(); for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++) { heros.add(new Hero(\u0026#34;hero \u0026#34; + i, r.nextInt(1000), r.nextInt(100))); } System.out.println(\u0026#34;初始化后的集合：\u0026#34;); System.out.println(heros); HeroChecker c = new HeroChecker() { public boolean test(Hero h) { return h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50; } }; System.out.println(\u0026#34;使用匿名类过滤\u0026#34;); filter(heros, c); System.out.println(\u0026#34;使用Lambda表达式\u0026#34;); filter(heros, h-\u0026gt;h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50); System.out.println(\u0026#34;在Lambda表达式中使用静态方法\u0026#34;); filter(heros, h -\u0026gt; TestLambda.testHero(h) ); System.out.println(\u0026#34;直接引用静态方法\u0026#34;); filter(heros, TestLambda::testHero); } public static boolean testHero(Hero h) { return h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50; } private static void filter(List\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt; heros, HeroChecker checker) { for (Hero hero : heros) { if (checker.test(hero)) System.out.print(hero); } } }   引用对象方法 与引用静态方法很类似，只是传递方法的时候，需要一个对象的存在\n1 2  TestLambda testLambda = new TestLambda(); filter(heros, testLambda::testHero);   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.Random; import charactor.Hero; public class TestLambda { public static void main(String[] args) { Random r = new Random(); List\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt; heros = new ArrayList\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt;(); for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++) { heros.add(new Hero(\u0026#34;hero \u0026#34; + i, r.nextInt(1000), r.nextInt(100))); } System.out.println(\u0026#34;初始化后的集合：\u0026#34;); System.out.println(heros); System.out.println(\u0026#34;使用引用对象方法 的过滤结果：\u0026#34;); //使用类的对象方法  TestLambda testLambda = new TestLambda(); filter(heros, testLambda::testHero); } public boolean testHero(Hero h) { return h.hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage\u0026lt;50; } private static void filter(List\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt; heros, HeroChecker checker) { for (Hero hero : heros) { if (checker.test(hero)) System.out.print(hero); } } }   引用构造器 有的接口中的方法会返回一个对象，比如java.util.function.Supplier提供 了一个get方法，返回一个对象。\n1 2 3  public interface Supplier\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { T get(); }   设计一个方法，参数是这个接口\n1 2 3  public static List getList(Supplier\u0026lt;List\u0026gt; s){ return s.get(); }   为了调用这个方法，有3种方式 第一种匿名类：\n1 2 3 4 5 6  Supplier\u0026lt;List\u0026gt; s = new Supplier\u0026lt;List\u0026gt;() { public List get() { return new ArrayList(); } }; List list1 = getList(s);   第二种：Lambda表达式\n1  List list2 = getList(()-\u0026gt;new ArrayList());   第三种：引用构造器\n1  List list3 = getList(ArrayList::new);   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.function.Supplier; public class TestLambda { public static void main(String[] args) { Supplier\u0026lt;List\u0026gt; s = new Supplier\u0026lt;List\u0026gt;() { public List get() { return new ArrayList(); } }; //匿名类  List list1 = getList(s); //Lambda表达式  List list2 = getList(()-\u0026gt;new ArrayList()); //引用构造器  List list3 = getList(ArrayList::new); } public static List getList(Supplier\u0026lt;List\u0026gt; s){ return s.get(); } }   聚合操作 传统方式与聚合操作方式遍历数据 遍历数据的传统方式就是使用for循环，然后条件判断，最后打印出满足条件的数据\n1 2 3 4  for (Hero h : heros) { if (h.hp \u0026gt; 100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage \u0026lt; 50) System.out.println(h.name); }   使用聚合操作方式，画风就发生了变化：\n1 2 3 4  heros .stream() .filter(h -\u0026gt; h.hp \u0026gt; 100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage \u0026lt; 50) .forEach(h -\u0026gt; System.out.println(h.name));   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.List; import java.util.Random; import charactor.Hero; public class TestAggregate { public static void main(String[] args) { Random r = new Random(); List\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt; heros = new ArrayList\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt;(); for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++) { heros.add(new Hero(\u0026#34;hero \u0026#34; + i, r.nextInt(1000), r.nextInt(100))); } System.out.println(\u0026#34;初始化后的集合：\u0026#34;); System.out.println(heros); System.out.println(\u0026#34;查询条件：hp\u0026gt;100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; damage\u0026lt;50\u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34;通过传统操作方式找出满足条件的数据：\u0026#34;); for (Hero h : heros) { if (h.hp \u0026gt; 100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage \u0026lt; 50) System.out.println(h.name); } System.out.println(\u0026#34;通过聚合操作方式找出满足条件的数据：\u0026#34;); heros .stream() .filter(h -\u0026gt; h.hp \u0026gt; 100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage \u0026lt; 50) .forEach(h -\u0026gt; System.out.println(h.name)); } }   Stream和管道的概念 1 2 3 4  heros .stream() .filter(h -\u0026gt; h.hp \u0026gt; 100 \u0026amp;\u0026amp; h.damage \u0026lt; 50) .forEach(h -\u0026gt; System.out.println(h.name));   要了解聚合操作，首先要建立Stream和管道的概念 Stream 和Collection结构化的数据不一样，Stream是一系列的元素，就像是生产线上的罐头一样，一串串的出来。 管道指的是一系列的聚合操作。\n管道又分3个部分 管道源：在这个例子里，源是一个List 中间操作： 每个中间操作，又会返回一个Stream，比如.filter()又返回一个Stream, 中间操作是“懒”操作，并不会真正进行遍历。 结束操作：当这个操作执行后，流就被使用“光”了，无法再被操作。所以这必定是流的最后一个操作。 结束操作不会返回Stream，但是会返回int、float、String、 Collection或者像forEach，什么都不返回, 结束操作才进行真正的遍历行为，在遍历的时候，才会去进行中间操作的相关判断\n注： 这个Stream和I/O章节的InputStream,OutputStream是不一样的概念。\n管道源 把Collection切换成管道源很简单，调用stream()就行了。\nheros.stream() 但是数组却没有stream()方法，需要使用\nArrays.stream(hs) 或者\nStream.of(hs)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.List; import java.util.Random; import charactor.Hero; public class TestAggregate { public static void main(String[] args) { Random r = new Random(); List\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt; heros = new ArrayList\u0026lt;Hero\u0026gt;(); for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 5; i++) { heros.add(new Hero(\u0026#34;hero \u0026#34; + i, r.nextInt(1000), r.nextInt(100))); } //管道源是集合  heros .stream()

每个中间操作，又会返回一个Stream，比如.filter()又返回一个Stream, 中间操作是“懒”操作，并不会真正进行遍历。 中间操作比较多，主要分两类 对元素进行筛选 和 转换为其他形式的流 对元素进行筛选： filter 匹配 distinct 去除重复(根据equals判断) sorted 自然排序 sorted(Comparator) 指定排序 limit 保留 skip 忽略 转换为其他形式的流 mapToDouble 转换为double的流 map 转换为任意类型的流\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52

多线程是Java语言的重要特性，大量应用于网络编程、服务器端程序的开发，最常见的UI界面底层原理、操作系统底层原理都大量使用了多线程。\n我们可以流畅的点击软件或者游戏中的各种按钮，其实，底层就是多线程的应用。UI界面的主线程绘制界面，如果有一个耗时的操作发生则启动新的线程，完全不影响主线程的工作。当这个线程工作完毕后，再更新到主界面上。\n我们可以上百人、上千人、上万人同时访问某个网站，其实，也是基于网站服务器的多线程原理。如果没有多线程，服务器处理速度会极大降低。\n多线程应用于计算机的各个方面，但是对于初学者，我们只需掌握基本的概念即可。在入门阶段，暂时没有必要钻研过深。\n程序 “程序(Program)”是一个静态的概念，一般对应于操作系统中的一个可执行文件，比如：我们要启动酷狗听音乐，则对应酷狗的可执行程序。当我们双击酷狗，则加载程序到内存中，开始执行该程序，于是产生了“进程”。\n进程 执行中的程序叫做进程(Process)，是一个动态的概念。现代的操作系统都可以同时启动多个进程。比如：我们在用酷狗听音乐，也可以使用eclipse写代码，也可以同时用浏览器查看网页。进程具有如下特点：\n\\1. 进程是程序的一次动态执行过程， 占用特定的地址空间。\n\\2. 每个进程由3部分组成：cpu、data、code。每个进程都是独立的，保有自己的cpu时间，代码和数据，即便用同一份程序产生好几个进程，它们之间还是拥有自己的这3样东西，这样的缺点是：浪费内存，cpu的负担较重。\n\\3. 多任务(Multitasking)操作系统将CPU时间动态地划分给每个进程，操作系统同时执行多个进程，每个进程独立运行。以进程的观点来看，它会以为自己独占CPU的使用权。\n\\4. 进程的查看\n​ Windows系统: Ctrl+Alt+Del，启动任务管理器即可查看所有进程。\n​ Unix系统: ps or top。\n线程 一个进程可以产生多个线程。同多个进程可以共享操作系统的某些资源一样，同一进程的多个线程也可以共享此进程的某些资源(比如：代码、数据)，所以线程又被称为轻量级进程(lightweight process)。\n\\1. 一个进程内部的一个执行单元，它是程序中的一个单一的顺序控制流程。\n\\2. 一个进程可拥有多个并行的(concurrent)线程。\n\\3. 一个进程中的多个线程共享相同的内存单元/内存地址空间，可以访问相同的变量和对象，而且它们从同一堆中分配对象并进行通信、数据交换和同步操作。\n\\4. 由于线程间的通信是在同一地址空间上进行的，所以不需要额外的通信机制，这就使得通信更简便而且信息传递的速度也更快。\n\\5. 线程的启动、中断、消亡，消耗的资源非常少。\n线程和进程的区别 \\1. 每个进程都有独立的代码和数据空间(进程上下文)，进程间的切换会有较大的开销。\n\\2. 线程可以看成是轻量级的进程，属于同一进程的线程共享代码和数据空间，每个线程有独立的运行栈和程序计数器(PC)，线程切换的开销小。\n\\3. 线程和进程最根本的区别在于：进程是资源分配的单位，线程是调度和执行的单位。\n\\4. 多进程: 在操作系统中能同时运行多个任务(程序)。\n\\5. 多线程: 在同一应用程序中有多个顺序流同时执行。\n\\6. 线程是进程的一部分，所以线程有的时候被称为轻量级进程。\n\\7. 一个没有线程的进程是可以被看作单线程的，如果一个进程内拥有多个线程，进程的执行过程不是一条线(线程)的，而是多条线(线程)共同完成的。\n\\8. 系统在运行的时候会为每个进程分配不同的内存区域，但是不会为线程分配内存(线程所使用的资源是它所属的进程的资源)，线程组只能共享资源。那就是说，除了CPU之外(线程在运行的时候要占用CPU资源)，计算机内部的软硬件资源的分配与线程无关，线程只能共享它所属进程的资源。\n进程与程序的区别 程序是一组指令的集合，它是静态的实体，没有执行的含义。而进程是一个动态的实体，有自己的生命周期。一般说来，一个进程肯定与一个程序相对应，并且只有一个，但是一个程序可以有多个进程，或者一个进程都没有。除此之外，进程还有并发性和交往性。简单地说，进程是程序的一部分，程序运行的时候会产生进程。\nJava中如何实现多线程 在Java中使用多线程非常简单，我们先学习如何创建和使用线程，然后再结合案例深入剖析线程的特性。\n通过继承Thread类实现多线程 继承Thread类实现多线程的步骤：\n\\1. 在Java中负责实现线程功能的类是java.lang.Thread 类。\n\\2. 可以通过创建 Thread的实例来创建新的线程。\n\\3. 每个线程都是通过某个特定的Thread对象所对应的方法run( )来完成其操作的，方法run( )称为线程体。\n\\4. 通过调用Thread类的start()方法来启动一个线程。\n**此种方式的缺点：**如果我们的类已经继承了一个类(如小程序必须继承自 Applet 类)，则无法再继承 Thread 类。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  public class TestThread extends Thread {//自定义类继承Thread类  //run()方法里是线程体  public void run() { for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 10; i++) { System.out.println(this.getName() + \u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + i);//getName()方法是返回线程名称  } } public static void main(String[] args) { TestThread thread1 = new TestThread();//创建线程对象  thread1.start();//启动线程  TestThread thread2 = new TestThread(); thread2.start(); } }   通过Runnable接口实现多线程 在开发中，我们应用更多的是通过Runnable接口实现多线程。这种方式克服了11.2.1节中实现线程类的缺点，即在实现Runnable接口的同时还可以继承某个类。所以实现Runnable接口的方式要通用一些。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  public class Demo02 implements Runnable { @Override public void run() { for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 10; i++) { System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName()+\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;+i); } } public static void main(String[] args) { Thread th1 = new Thread(new Demo02()); th1.start(); Thread th2 = new Thread(new Demo02()); } }   线程状态 一个线程对象在它的生命周期内，需要经历5个状态。\n▪ 新生状态(New)\n用new关键字建立一个线程对象后，该线程对象就处于新生状态。处于新生状态的线程有自己的内存空间，通过调用start方法进入就绪状态。\n▪ 就绪状态(Runnable)\n处于就绪状态的线程已经具备了运行条件，但是还没有被分配到CPU，处于“线程就绪队列”，等待系统为其分配CPU。就绪状态并不是执行状态，当系统选定一个等待执行的Thread对象后，它就会进入执行状态。一旦获得CPU，线程就进入运行状态并自动调用自己的run方法。有4中原因会导致线程进入就绪状态：\n  新建线程：调用start()方法，进入就绪状态;\n  阻塞线程：阻塞解除，进入就绪状态;\n  运行线程：调用yield()方法，直接进入就绪状态;\n  运行线程：JVM将CPU资源从本线程切换到其他线程。\n  ▪ 运行状态(Running)\n在运行状态的线程执行自己run方法中的代码，直到调用其他方法而终止或等待某资源而阻塞或完成任务而死亡。如果在给定的时间片内没有执行结束，就会被系统给换下来回到就绪状态。也可能由于某些“导致阻塞的事件”而进入阻塞状态。\n▪ 阻塞状态(Blocked)\n阻塞指的是暂停一个线程的执行以等待某个条件发生(如某资源就绪)。有4种原因会导致阻塞：\n\\1. 执行sleep(int millsecond)方法，使当前线程休眠，进入阻塞状态。当指定的时间到了后，线程进入就绪状态。\n\\2. 执行wait()方法，使当前线程进入阻塞状态。当使用nofity()方法唤醒这个线程后，它进入就绪状态。\n\\3. 线程运行时，某个操作进入阻塞状态，比如执行IO流操作(read()/write()方法本身就是阻塞的方法)。只有当引起该操作阻塞的原因消失后，线程进入就绪状态。\n\\4. join()线程联合: 当某个线程等待另一个线程执行结束后，才能继续执行时，使用join()方法。\n▪ 死亡状态(Terminated)\n死亡状态是线程生命周期中的最后一个阶段。线程死亡的原因有两个。一个是正常运行的线程完成了它run()方法内的全部工作; 另一个是线程被强制终止，如通过执行stop()或destroy()方法来终止一个线程(注：stop()/destroy()方法已经被JDK废弃，不推荐使用)。\n当一个线程进入死亡状态以后，就不能再回到其它状态了。\n终止线程的典型方式 终止线程我们一般不使用JDK提供的stop()/destroy()方法(它们本身也被JDK废弃了)。通常的做法是提供一个boolean型的终止变量，当这个变量置为false，则终止线程的运行。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37

sleep()方法：可以让正在运行的线程进入阻塞状态，直到休眠时间满了，进入就绪状态。\n  yield()方法：可以让正在运行的线程直接进入就绪状态，让出CPU的使用权。\n  暂停（sleep）：\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  public class TestThreadState { public static void main(String[] args) { StateThread thread1 = new StateThread(); thread1.start(); StateThread thread2 = new StateThread(); thread2.start(); } } //使用继承方式实现多线程 class StateThread extends Thread { public void run() { for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 100; i++) { System.out.println(this.getName() + \u0026#34;:\u0026#34; + i); try { Thread.sleep(2000);//调用线程的sleep()方法；  } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } }   暂停线程方法（yield）：\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  public class TestThreadState { public static void main(String[] args) { StateThread thread1 = new

线程A在运行期间，可以调用线程B的join()方法，让线程B和线程A联合。这样，线程A就必须等待线程B执行完毕后，才能继续执行。如下面示例中，“爸爸线程”要抽烟，于是联合了“儿子线程”去买烟，必须等待“儿子线程”买烟完毕，“爸爸线程”才能继续抽烟。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28

newPriority);\n注意：优先级低只是意味着获得调度的概率低。并不是绝对先调用优先级高的线程后调用优先级低的线程。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  public class TestThread { public static void main(String[] args) { Thread t1 = new Thread(new

比如：教室里，只有一台电脑，多个人都想使用。天然的解决办法就是，在电脑旁边，大家排队。前一人使用完后，后一人再使用。\n▪ 线程同步的概念\n处理多线程问题时，多个线程访问同一个对象，并且某些线程还想修改这个对象。 这时候，我们就需要用到“线程同步”。 线程同步其实就是一种等待机制，多个需要同时访问此对象的线程进入这个对象的等待池形成队列，等待前面的线程使用完毕后，下一个线程再使用。\n多线程操作同一个对象(未使用线程同步)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52  public class TestSync { public static void main(String[] args) { Account a1 = new Account(100, \u0026#34;高\u0026#34;); Drawing draw1 = new Drawing(80, a1);// 定义取钱线程对象；  Drawing draw2 = new Drawing(80, a1);// 定义取钱线程对象；  draw1.start(); // 你取钱  draw2.start(); // 你老婆取钱  } } /* * 简单表示银行账户 */ class Account { int money; String aname; public Account(int money, String aname) { super(); this.money = money; this.aname = aname; } } /** * 模拟提款操作 */ class Drawing extends Thread { int drawingNum; // 取多少钱  Account account; // 要取钱的账户  int expenseTotal; // 总共取的钱数  public Drawing(int drawingNum, Account account) { super(); this.drawingNum = drawingNum; this.account = account; } @Override public void run() { if (account.money - drawingNum \u0026lt; 0) { return; } try { Thread.sleep(1000); // 判断完后阻塞。其他线程开始运行。  } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } account.money -= drawingNum; expenseTotal += drawingNum; System.out.println(this.getName() + \u0026#34;--账户余额：\u0026#34; + account.money); System.out.println(this.getName() + \u0026#34;--总共取了：\u0026#34; + expenseTotal); } }   没有线程同步机制，两个线程同时操作同一个账户对象，竟然从只有100元的账户，轻松取出80*2=160元，账户余额竟然成为了-60。这么大的问题，显然银行不会答应的。\n实现多线程同步 由于同一进程的多个线程共享同一块存储空间，在带来方便的同时，也带来了访问冲突的问题。Java语言提供了专门机制以解决这种冲突，有效避免了同一个数据对象被多个线程同时访问造成的这种问题。\n由于我们可以通过 private 关键字来保证数据对象只能被方法访问，所以我们只需针对方法提出一套机制，这套机制就是synchronized关键字，它包括两种用法：synchronized 方法和 synchronized 块。\nsynchronized 方法\n1  public synchronized void accessVal(int newVal);   synchronized 方法控制对“对象的类成员变量”的访问：每个对象对应一把锁，每个 synchronized 方法都必须获得调用该方法的对象的锁方能执行，否则所属线程阻塞，方法一旦执行，就独占该锁，直到从该方法返回时才将锁释放，此后被阻塞的线程方能获得该锁，重新进入可执行状态。\nsynchronized块\nsynchronized 方法的缺陷：若将一个大的方法声明为synchronized 将会大大影响效率。\nJava 为我们提供了更好的解决办法，那就是 synchronized 块。 块可以让我们精确地控制到具体的“成员变量”，缩小同步的范围，提高效率。\nsynchronized 块：通过 synchronized关键字来声明synchronized 块，语法如下：\n1 2 3 4  synchronized(syncObject) { //允许访问控制的代码 　}   多线程操作一个对象\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61  public class TestSync { public static void main(String[] args) { Account a1 = new Account(100, \u0026#34;高\u0026#34;); Drawing draw1 = new Drawing(80, a1); Drawing draw2 = new Drawing(80, a1); draw1.start(); // 你取钱  draw2.start(); // 你老婆取钱  } } /* * 简单表示银行账户 */ class Account { int money; String aname; public Account(int money, String aname) { super(); this.money = money; this.aname = aname; } } /** * 模拟提款操作 * * @author Administrator * */ class Drawing extends Thread { int drawingNum; // 取多少钱  Account account; // 要取钱的账户  int expenseTotal; // 总共取的钱数  public Drawing(int drawingNum, Account account) { super(); this.drawingNum = drawingNum; this.account = account; } @Override public void run() { draw(); } void draw() { synchronized (account) { if (account.money - drawingNum \u0026lt; 0) { System.out.println(this.getName() + \u0026#34;取款，余额不足！\u0026#34;); return; } try { Thread.sleep(1000); // 判断完后阻塞。其他线程开始运行。  } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } account.money -= drawingNum; expenseTotal += drawingNum; } System.out.println(this.getName() + \u0026#34;--账户余额：\u0026#34; + account.money); System.out.println(this.getName() + \u0026#34;--总共取了：\u0026#34; + expenseTotal); } }   “synchronized (account)” 意味着线程需要获得account对象的“锁”才有资格运行同步块中的代码。 Account对象的“锁”也称为“互斥锁”，在同一时刻只能被一个线程使用。A线程拥有锁，则可以调用“同步块”中的代码;B线程没有锁，则进入account对象的“锁池队列”等待，直到A线程使用完毕释放了account对象的锁，B线程得到锁才可以开始调用“同步块”中的代码。\n死锁 死锁的概念\n“死锁”指的是：\n多个线程各自占有一些共享资源，并且互相等待其他线程占有的资源才能进行，而导致两个或者多个线程都在等待对方释放资源，都停止执行的情形。\n因此， 某一个同步块需要同时拥有“两个以上对象的锁”时，就可能会发生“死锁”的问题。下面案例中，“化妆线程”需要同时拥有“镜子对象”、“口红对象”才能运行同步块。那么，实际运行时，“小丫的化妆线程”拥有了“镜子对象”，“大丫的化妆线程”拥有了“口红对象”，都在互相等待对方释放资源，才能化妆。这样，两个线程就形成了互相等待，无法继续运行的“死锁状态”。\n【示例11-11】死锁问题演示\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62  class Lipstick {//口红类  } class Mirror {//镜子类  } class Makeup extends Thread {//化妆类继承了Thread类  int flag; String girl; static Lipstick lipstick = new Lipstick(); static Mirror mirror = new Mirror(); @Override public void run() { // TODO Auto-generated method stub  doMakeup(); } void doMakeup() { if (flag == 0) { synchronized (lipstick) {//需要得到口红的“锁”；  System.out.println(girl + \u0026#34;拿着口红！\u0026#34;); try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } synchronized (mirror) {//需要得到镜子的“锁”；  System.out.println(girl + \u0026#34;拿着镜子！\u0026#34;); } } } else { synchronized (mirror) { System.out.println(girl + \u0026#34;拿着镜子！\u0026#34;); try { Thread.sleep(2000); } catch (InterruptedException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } synchronized (lipstick) { System.out.println(girl + \u0026#34;拿着口红！\u0026#34;); } } } } } public class TestDeadLock { public static void main(String[] args) { Makeup m1 = new Makeup();//大丫的化妆线程；  m1.girl = \u0026#34;大丫\u0026#34;; m1.flag = 0; Makeup m2 = new Makeup();//小丫的化妆线程；  m2.girl = \u0026#34;小丫\u0026#34;; m2.flag = 1; m1.start(); m2.start(); } }   两线程都在等对方的资源，都处于停滞状态)\n死锁的解决方法\n死锁是由于“同步块需要同时持有多个对象锁造成”的，要解决这个问题，思路很简单，就是：同一个代码块，不要同时持有两个对象锁\n线程并发协作(生产者/消费者模式) 多线程环境下，我们经常需要多个线程的并发和协作。这个时候，就需要了解一个重要的多线程并发协作模型“生产者/消费者模式”。\nØ 什么是生产者?\n生产者指的是负责生产数据的模块(这里模块可能是：方法、对象、线程、进程)。\nØ 什么是消费者?\n消费者指的是负责处理数据的模块(这里模块可能是：方法、对象、线程、进程)。\nØ 什么是缓冲区?\n消费者不能直接使用生产者的数据，它们之间有个“缓冲区”。生产者将生产好的数据放入“缓冲区”，消费者从“缓冲区”拿要处理的数据\n缓冲区是实现并发的核心，缓冲区的设置有3个好处：\nØ 实现线程的并发协作\n有了缓冲区以后，生产者线程只需要往缓冲区里面放置数据，而不需要管消费者消费的情况;同样，消费者只需要从缓冲区拿数据处理即可，也不需要管生产者生产的情况。 这样，就从逻辑上实现了“生产者线程”和“消费者线程”的分离。\nØ 解耦了生产者和消费者\n生产者不需要和消费者直接打交道。\nØ 解决忙闲不均，提高效率\n生产者生产数据慢时，缓冲区仍有数据，不影响消费者消费;消费者处理数据慢时，生产者仍然可以继续往缓冲区里面放置数据 。\n线程并发协作总结：\n线程并发协作(也叫线程通信)，通常用于生产者/消费者模式，情景如下：\n\\1. 生产者和消费者共享同一个资源，并且生产者和消费者之间相互依赖，互为条件。\n\\2. 对于生产者，没有生产产品之前，消费者要进入等待状态。而生产了产品之后，又需要马上通知消费者消费。\n\\3. 对于消费者，在消费之后，要通知生产者已经消费结束，需要继续生产新产品以供消费。\n\\4. 在生产者消费者问题中，仅有synchronized是不够的。\n​ · synchronized可阻止并发更新同一个共享资源，实现了同步;\n​ · synchronized不能用来实现不同线程之间的消息传递(通信)。\n\\5. 那线程是通过哪些方法来进行消息传递(通信)的呢?见如下总结：\n\\6. 以上方法均是java.lang.Object类的方法;\n都只能在同步方法或者同步代码块中使用，否则会抛出异常。\n任务定时调度 通过Timer和Timetask，我们可以实现定时启动某个线程。\njava.util.Timer\n在这种实现方式中，Timer类作用是类似闹钟的功能，也就是定时或者每隔一定时间触发一次线程。其实，Timer类本身实现的就是一个线程，只是这个线程是用来实现调用其它线程的。\njava.util.TimerTask\nTimerTask类是一个抽象类，该类实现了Runnable接口，所以该类具备多线程的能力。\n在这种实现方式中，通过继承TimerTask使该类获得多线程的能力，将需要多线程执行的代码书写在run方法内部，然后通过Timer类启动线程的执行。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  public class TestTimer { public static void main(String[] args) { Timer t1 = new Timer();//定义计时器；  MyTask task1 = new MyTask();//定义任务；  t1.schedule(task1,3000); //3秒后执行；  //t1.schedule(task1,5000,1000);//5秒以后每隔1秒执行一次！  //GregorianCalendar calendar1 = new GregorianCalendar(2010,0,5,14,36,57);  //t1.schedule(task1,calendar1.getTime()); //指定时间定时执行；  } } class MyTask extends TimerTask {//自定义线程类继承TimerTask类；  public void run() { for(int i=0;i\u0026lt;10;i++){ System.out.println(\u0026#34;任务1:\u0026#34;+i); } } }   运行以上程序时，可以感觉到在输出之前有明显的延迟(大概就是3秒!)。还有几个方法，我注释掉了，大家自己试试吧!\n在实际使用时，一个Timer可以启动任意多个TimerTask实现的线程，但是多个线程之间会存在阻塞。所以如果多个线程之间需要完全独立的话，最好还是一个Timer启动一个TimerTask实现。\n老鸟建议\n实际开发中，我们可以使用开源框架quanz，更加方便的实现任务定时调度。实际上，quanz底层原理就是我们这里介绍的内容。\n","date":"2020-01-20","permalink":"https://yang419.com/xian-cheng/","summary":"基本概念

对于任何程序设计语言而言，输入输出(Input/Output)系统都是非常核心的功能。程序运行需要数据，数据的获取往往需要跟外部系统进行通信，外部系统可能是文件、数据库、其他程序、网络、IO设备等等。外部系统比较复杂多变，那么我们有必要通过某种手段进行抽象、屏蔽外部的差异，从而实现更加便捷的编程。\n🉑 输入(Input)指的是：可以让程序从外部系统获得数据(核心含义是“读”，读取外部数据)。常见的应用：\nØ 读取硬盘上的文件内容到程序。例如：播放器打开一个视频文件、word打开一个doc文件。\nØ 读取网络上某个位置内容到程序。例如：浏览器中输入网址后，打开该网址对应的网页内容;下载网络上某个网址的文件。\nØ 读取数据库系统的数据到程序。\nØ 读取某些硬件系统数据到程序。例如：车载电脑读取雷达扫描信息到程序;温控系统等。\n输出(Output)指的是：程序输出数据给外部系统从而可以操作外部系统(核心含义是“写”，将数据写出到外部系统)。常见的应用有：\nØ 将数据写到硬盘中。例如：我们编辑完一个word文档后，将内容写到硬盘上进行保存。\nØ 将数据写到数据库系统中。例如：我们注册一个网站会员，实际就是后台程序向数据库中写入一条记录。\nØ 将数据写到某些硬件系统中。例如：导弹系统导航程序将新的路径输出到飞控子系统，飞控子系统根据数据修正飞行路径。\njava.io包为我们提供了相关的API，实现了对所有外部系统的输入输出操作，这就是我们这章所要学习的技术。\n数据源 数据源data source，提供数据的原始媒介。常见的数据源有：数据库、文件、其他程序、内存、网络连接、IO设备。如图10-1所示。\n数据源分为：源设备、目标设备。\n  源设备：为程序提供数据，一般对应输入流。\n  目标设备：程序数据的目的地，一般对应输出流。\n  流的概念 流是一个抽象、动态的概念，是一连串连续动态的数据集合。\n对于输入流而言，数据源就像水箱，流(stream)就像水管中流动着的水流，程序就是我们最终的用户。我们通过流(A Stream)将数据源(Source)中的数据(information)输送到程序(Program)中。\n对于输出流而言，目标数据源就是目的地(dest)，我们通过流(A Stream)将程序(Program)中的数据(information)输送到目的数据源(dest)中。\n第一个简单的IO流程序及深入理解 当程序需要读取数据源的数据时，就会通过IO流对象开启一个通向数据源的流，通过这个IO流对象的相关方法可以顺序读取数据源中的数据。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24

System.out.println(sb); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { try{ if(fis != null){ fis.close(); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } } //123   Java中流的概念细分 按流的方向分类：\n\\1. 输入流：数据流向是数据源到程序(以InputStream、Reader结尾的流)。\n\\2. 输出流：数据流向是程序到目的地(以OutPutStream、Writer结尾的流)。\n按处理的数据单元分类：\n\\1. 字节流：以字节为单位获取数据，命名上以Stream结尾的流一般是字节流，如FileInputStream、FileOutputStream。\n\\2. 字符流：以字符为单位获取数据，命名上以Reader/Writer结尾的流一般是字符流，如FileReader、FileWriter。\n按处理对象不同分类：\n\\1. 节点流：可以直接从数据源或目的地读写数据，如FileInputStream、FileReader、DataInputStream等。\n\\2. 处理流：不直接连接到数据源或目的地，是”处理流的流”。通过对其他流的处理提高程序的性能，如BufferedInputStream、BufferedReader等。处理流也叫包装流。\n节点流处于IO操作的第一线，所有操作必须通过它们进行;处理流可以对节点流进行包装，提高性能或提高程序的灵活性。 Java中IO流类的体系 \\1. InputStream/OutputStream\n​ 字节流的抽象类。\n\\2. Reader/Writer\n​ 字符流的抽象类。\n\\3. FileInputStream/FileOutputStream\n​ 节点流：以字节为单位直接操作“文件”。\n\\4. ByteArrayInputStream/ByteArrayOutputStream\n​ 节点流：以字节为单位直接操作“字节数组对象”。\n\\5. ObjectInputStream/ObjectOutputStream\n​ 处理流：以字节为单位直接操作“对象”。\n\\6. DataInputStream/DataOutputStream\n​ 处理流：以字节为单位直接操作“基本数据类型与字符串类型”。\n\\7. FileReader/FileWriter\n​ 节点流：以字符为单位直接操作“文本文件”(注意：只能读写文本文件)。\n\\8. BufferedReader/BufferedWriter\n​ 处理流：将Reader/Writer对象进行包装，增加缓存功能，提高读写效率。\n\\9. BufferedInputStream/BufferedOutputStream\n​ 处理流：将InputStream/OutputStream对象进行包装，增加缓存功能，提高 读写效率。\n\\10. InputStreamReader/OutputStreamWriter\n​ 处理流：将字节流对象转化成字符流对象。\n\\11. PrintStream\n​ 处理流：将OutputStream进行包装，可以方便地输出字符，更加灵活。\n老鸟建议\n上面的解释，一句话就点中了流的核心作用。大家在后面学习的时候，用心体会。\n四大IO抽象类 InputStream/OutputStream和Reader/writer类是所有IO流类的抽象父类，我们有必要简单了解一下这个四个抽象类的作用。然后，通过它们具体的子类熟悉相关的用法。\n·InputStream\n此抽象类是表示字节输入流的所有类的父类。InputSteam是一个抽象类，它不可以实例化。 数据的读取需要由它的子类来实现。根据节点的不同，它派生了不同的节点流子类 。\n继承自InputSteam的流都是用于向程序中输入数据，且数据的单位为字节(8 bit)。\n常用方法：\nint read()：读取一个字节的数据，并将字节的值作为int类型返回(0-255之间的一个值)。如果未读出字节则返回-1(返回值为-1表示读取结束)。\nvoid close()：关闭输入流对象，释放相关系统资源。\n· OutputStream\n此抽象类是表示字节输出流的所有类的父类。输出流接收输出字节并将这些字节发送到某个目的地。\n常用方法：\nvoid write(int n)：向目的地中写入一个字节。\nvoid close()：关闭输出流对象，释放相关系统资源。\n· Reader\nReader用于读取的字符流抽象类，数据单位为字符。\nint read(): 读取一个字符的数据，并将字符的值作为int类型返回(0-65535之间的一个值，即Unicode值)。如果未读出字符则返回-1(返回值为-1表示读取结束)。\nvoid close() ： 关闭流对象，释放相关系统资源。\n· Writer\nWriter用于写入的字符流抽象类，数据单位为字符。\nvoid write(int n)： 向输出流中写入一个字符。\nvoid close() ： 关闭输出流对象，释放相关系统资源。\n文件字节流 FileInputStream通过字节的方式读取文件，适合读取所有类型的文件(图像、视频、文本文件等)。Java也提供了FileReader专门读取文本文件。\nFileOutputStream 通过字节的方式写数据到文件中，适合所有类型的文件。Java也提供了FileWriter专门写入文本文件。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24  import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; public class TestFileOutputStream { public static void main(String[] args) { FileOutputStream fos = null; String string = \u0026#34;北京尚学堂欢迎您！\u0026#34;; try { // true表示内容会追加到文件末尾；false表示重写整个文件内容。  fos = new FileOutputStream(\u0026#34;d:/a.txt\u0026#34;, true); //该方法是直接将一个字节数组写入文件中; 而write(int n)是写入一个字节  fos.write(string.getBytes()); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { try { if (fos != null) { fos.close(); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } }   用到一个write方法：void write(byte[ ] b)，该方法不再一个字节一个字节地写入，而是直接写入一个字节数组;另外其还有一个重载的方法：void write(byte[ ] b, int off, int length)，这个方法也是写入一个字节数组，但是我们程序员可以指定从字节数组的哪个位置开始写入，写入的长度是多少。\n使用文件流实现文件复制\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52  import java.io.FileInputStream;

} /** * 将src文件的内容拷贝到dec文件 * @param src 源文件 * @param dec 目标文件 */ static void copyFile(String src, String dec) { FileInputStream fis = null; FileOutputStream fos = null; //为了提高效率，设置缓存数组！（读取的字节数据会暂存放到该字节数组中）  byte[] buffer = new byte[1024]; int temp = 0; try { fis = new FileInputStream(src); fos = new FileOutputStream(dec); //边读边写  //temp指的是本次读取的真实长度，temp等于-1时表示读取结束  while ((temp = fis.read(buffer)) != -1) { /*将缓存数组中的数据写入文件中，注意：写入的是读取的真实长度； *如果使用fos.write(buffer)方法，那么写入的长度将会是1024，即缓存 *数组的长度*/ fos.write(buffer, 0, temp); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { //两个流需要分别关闭  try { if (fos != null) { fos.close(); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } try { if (fis != null) { fis.close(); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } }   注意\n在使用文件字节流时，我们需要注意以下两点：\n\\1. 为了减少对硬盘的读写次数，提高效率，通常设置缓存数组。相应地，读取时使用的方法为：read(byte[] b);写入时的方法为：write(byte[ ] b, int off, int length)。\n\\2. 程序中如果遇到多个流，每个流都要单独关闭，防止其中一个流出现异常后导致其他流无法关闭的情况。\n文件字符流 前面介绍的文件字节流可以处理所有的文件，但是字节流不能很好的处理Unicode字符，经常会出现“乱码”现象。所以，我们处理文本文件，一般可以使用文件字符流，它以字符为单位进行操作。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42  import java.io.FileNotFoundException;

FileWriter fw = null; int len = 0; try { fr = new FileReader(\u0026#34;d:/a.txt\u0026#34;); fw = new FileWriter(\u0026#34;d:/d.txt\u0026#34;); //为了提高效率，创建缓冲用的字符数组  char[] buffer = new char[1024]; //边读边写  while ((len = fr.read(buffer)) != -1) { fw.write(buffer, 0, len); } } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { try { if (fw != null) { fw.close(); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } try { if (fr != null) { fr.close(); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } }   缓冲字节流 ava缓冲流本身并不具有IO流的读取与写入功能，只是在别的流(节点流或其他处理流)上加上缓冲功能提高效率，就像是把别的流包装起来一样，因此缓冲流是一种处理流(包装流)。\n当对文件或者其他数据源进行频繁的读写操作时，效率比较低，这时如果使用缓冲流就能够更高效的读写信息。因为缓冲流是先将数据缓存起来，然后当缓存区存满后或者手动刷新时再一次性的读取到程序或写入目的地。\n因此，缓冲流还是很重要的，我们在IO操作时记得加上缓冲流来提升性能。\nBufferedInputStream和BufferedOutputStream这两个流是缓冲字节流，通过内部缓存数组来提高操作流的效率。\n下面我们通过两种方式(普通文件字节流与缓冲文件字节流)实现一个视频文件的复制，来体会一下缓冲流的好处。\n使用缓冲流实现文件的高效率复制\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105  import java.io.BufferedInputStream;

} } if (bw != null) { try { bw.close(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } } }   序列化和反序列化是什么 当两个进程远程通信时，彼此可以发送各种类型的数据。 无论是何种类型的数据，都会以二进制序列的形式在网络上传送。比如，我们可以通过http协议发送字符串信息;我们也可以在网络上直接发送Java对象。发送方需要把这个Java对象转换为字节序列，才能在网络上传送;接收方则需要把字节序列再恢复为Java对象才能正常读取。\n把Java对象转换为字节序列的过程称为对象的序列化。把字节序列恢复为Java对象的过程称为对象的反序列化。\n对象序列化的作用有如下两种：\n\\1. 持久化： 把对象的字节序列永久地保存到硬盘上，通常存放在一个文件中，比如：休眠的实现。以后服务器session管理，hibernate将对象持久化实现。\n\\2. 网络通信：在网络上传送对象的字节序列。比如：服务器之间的数据通信、对象传递。\n序列化涉及的类和接口 ObjectOutputStream代表对象输出流，它的writeObject(Object obj)方法可对参数指定的obj对象进行序列化，把得到的字节序列写到一个目标输出流中。\nObjectInputStream代表对象输入流，它的readObject()方法从一个源输入流中读取字节序列，再把它们反序列化为一个对象，并将其返回。\n只有实现了Serializable接口的类的对象才能被序列化。 Serializable接口是一个空接口，只起到标记作用。\n序列化/反序列化的步骤和实例 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84  import java.io.FileInputStream;

BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(fis);   显然BufferedInputStream装饰了原有的FileInputStream，让普通的FileInputStream也具备了缓存功能，提高了效率。 大家举一反三，可以翻看本章代码，看看还有哪些地方使用了装饰器模式。\nApache IOUtils和FileUtils的使用 JDK中提供的文件操作相关的类，但是功能都非常基础，进行复杂操作时需要做大量编程工作。实际开发中，往往需要你自己动手编写相关的代码，尤其在遍历目录文件时，经常用到递归，非常繁琐。 Apache-commons工具包中提供了IOUtils/FileUtils，可以让我们非常方便的对文件和目录进行操作。 本文就是让大家对IOUtils/FileUtils类有一个全面的认识，便于大家以后开发与文件和目录相关的功能。\nApache IOUtils和FileUtils类库为我们提供了更加简单、功能更加强大的文件操作和IO流操作功能。非常值得大家学习和使用。\nApache软件基金会 Apache软件基金会(也就是Apache Software Foundation，简称为ASF)，是专门为支持开源软件项目而办的一个非盈利性组织。在它所支持的Apache项目与子项目中，所发行的软件产品都遵循Apache许可证(Apache License)。 官方网址为：www.apache.org 。\n很多著名的Java开源项目都来源于这个组织。比如：commons、kafka、lucene、maven、shiro、struts等技术，以及大数据技术中的：hadoop(大数据第一技术)、hbase、spark、storm、mahout等。\nFileUtils的妙用 新手雷区\n很多初学者会忘记配置项目的classpath，从而项目找不到相关的jar包。大家可以在此处多配置几次，直到足够熟练!\n· FieUtils类中常用方法的介绍\n打开FileUtils的api文档，我们抽出一些工作中比较常用的方法，进行总结和讲解。总结如下：\ncleanDirectory：清空目录，但不删除目录。\ncontentEquals：比较两个文件的内容是否相同。\ncopyDirectory：将一个目录内容拷贝到另一个目录。可以通过FileFilter过滤需要拷贝的 文件。\ncopyFile：将一个文件拷贝到一个新的地址。\ncopyFileToDirectory：将一个文件拷贝到某个目录下。\ncopyInputStreamToFile：将一个输入流中的内容拷贝到某个文件。\ndeleteDirectory：删除目录。\ndeleteQuietly：删除文件。\nlistFiles：列出指定目录下的所有文件。\nopenInputSteam：打开指定文件的输入流。\nreadFileToString：将文件内容作为字符串返回。\nreadLines：将文件内容按行返回到一个字符串数组中。\nsize：返回文件或目录的大小。\nwrite：将字符串内容直接写到文件中。\nwriteByteArrayToFile:将字节数组内容写到文件中。\nwriteLines：将容器中的元素的toString方法返回的内容依次写入文件中。\nwriteStringToFile：将字符串内容写到文件中。\n读取文件内容，并输出到控制台上(只需一行代码!)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  import java.io.File;

 } }   ArrayList特点及底层实现 ArrayList底层是用数组实现的存储。 特点：查询效率高，增删效率低，线程不安全。我们一般使用它。查看源码：\n我们可以看出ArrayList底层使用Object数组来存储元素数据。所有的方法，都围绕这个核心的Object数组来开展。\n我们知道，数组长度是有限的，而ArrayList是可以存放任意数量的对象，长度不受限制，那么它是怎么实现的呢?本质上就是通过定义新的更大的数组，将旧数组中的内容拷贝到新数组，来实现扩容。 ArrayList的Object数组初始化长度为10，如果我们存储满了这个数组，需要存储第11个对象，就会定义新的长度更大的数组，并将原数组内容和新的元素一起加入到新数组中，源码如下：\nLinkedList特点和底层实现 LinkedList底层用双向链表实现的存储。特点：查询效率低，增删效率高，线程不安全。\n双向链表也叫双链表，是链表的一种，它的每个数据节点中都有两个指针，分别指向前一个节点和后一个节点。 所以，从双向链表中的任意一个节点开始，都可以很方便地找到所有节点。\n![图9-8 LinkedList的存储结构图.png](/Volumes/Untitled 1/笔记/Java/img/LinkedList存储结构图.png)\n每个节点都应该有3部分内容：\n1 2 3 4 5  class Node { Node previous; //前一个节点  Object element; //本节点保存的数据  Node next; //后一个节点 }   我们查看LinkedList的源码，可以看到里面包含了双向链表的相关代码：\n![图9-9 LinkedList的底层源码.png](/Volumes/Untitled 1/笔记/Java/img/LinkedList的底层源码.png)\n注意事项\nentry在英文中表示“进入、词条、条目”的意思。在计算机英语中一般表示“项、条目”的含义。\nVector向量 Vector底层是用数组实现的List，相关的方法都加了同步检查，因此“线程安全,效率低”。 比如，indexOf方法就增加了synchronized同步标记。\n如何选用ArrayList、LinkedList、Vector?   需要线程安全时，用Vector。\n  不存在线程安全问题时，并且查找较多用ArrayList(一般使用它)。\n 不存在线程安全问题时，增加或删除元素较多用LinkedList。    Map接口 Map就是用来存储“键(key)-值(value) 对”的。 Map类中存储的“键值对”通过键来标识，所以“键对象”不能重复。\nMap 接口的实现类有HashMap、TreeMap、HashTable、Properties等。\nHashMap和HashTable HashMap采用哈希算法实现，是Map接口最常用的实现类。 由于底层采用了哈希表存储数据，我们要求键不能重复，如果发生重复，新的键值对会替换旧的键值对。 HashMap在查找、删除、修改方面都有非常高的效率。\nMap接口中常用方法 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  public class TestMap { public static void main(String[] args) { Map\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt; m1 = new HashMap\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt;(); Map\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt; m2 = new HashMap\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt;(); m1.put(1, \u0026#34;one\u0026#34;); m1.put(2, \u0026#34;two\u0026#34;); m1.put(3, \u0026#34;three\u0026#34;); m2.put(1, \u0026#34;一\u0026#34;); m2.put(2, \u0026#34;二\u0026#34;); System.out.println(m1.size()); System.out.println(m1.containsKey(1)); System.out.println(m2.containsValue(\u0026#34;two\u0026#34;)); m1.put(3, \u0026#34;third\u0026#34;); //键重复了，则会替换旧的键值对  Map\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt; m3 = new HashMap\u0026lt;Integer, String\u0026gt;(); m3.putAll(m1); m3.putAll(m2); System.out.println(\u0026#34;m1:\u0026#34;

HashMap: 线程不安全，效率高。允许key或value为null。\n\\2. HashTable: 线程安全，效率低。不允许key或value为null。\nHashMap底层实现 HashMap底层实现采用了哈希表，这是一种非常重要的数据结构。对于我们以后理解很多技术都非常有帮助(比如：redis数据库的核心技术和HashMap一样)，因此，非常有必要让大家理解。\n数据结构中由数组和链表来实现对数据的存储，他们各有特点。\n(1) 数组：占用空间连续。 寻址容易，查询速度快。但是，增加和删除效率非常低。\n(2) 链表：占用空间不连续。 寻址困难，查询速度慢。但是，增加和删除效率非常高。\n那么，我们能不能结合数组和链表的优点(即查询快，增删效率也高)呢? 答案就是“哈希表”。 哈希表的本质就是“数组+链表”。\nHashmap基本结构讲解\n哈希表的基本结构就是“数组+链表”。我们打开HashMap源码，发现有如下两个核心内容：\n其中的Entry[] table 就是HashMap的核心数组结构，我们也称之为“位桶数组”。我们再继续看Entry是什么，源码如下\n：一个Entry对象存储了：\n\\1. key：键对象 value：值对象\n\\2. next:下一个节点\n\\3. hash: 键对象的hash值\n显然每一个Entry对象就是一个单向链表结构，我们使用图形表示一个Entry对象的典型示意：\n然后，我们画出Entry[]数组的结构(这也是HashMap的结构)：\n▪ 存储数据过程put(key,value)\n明白了HashMap的基本结构后，我们继续深入学习HashMap如何存储数据。此处的核心是如何产生hash值，该值用来对应数组的存储位置。\n![图9-16 HashMap存储数据过程示意图.png](/Volumes/Untitled 1/笔记/Java/img/HashMap存储数据结构图.png)\n我们的目的是将”key-value两个对象”成对存放到HashMap的Entry[]数组中。参见以下步骤：\n(1) 获得key对象的hashcode\n​ 首先调用key对象的hashcode()方法，获得hashcode。\n(2) 根据hashcode计算出hash值(要求在[0, 数组长度-1]区间)\n​ hashcode是一个整数，我们需要将它转化成[0, 数组长度-1]的范围。我们要求转化后的hash值尽量均匀地分布在[0,数组长度-1]这个区间，减少“hash冲突”\n​ i. 一种极端简单和低下的算法是：\n​ hash值 = hashcode/hashcode;\n​ 也就是说，hash值总是1。意味着，键值对对象都会存储到数组索引1位置，这样就形成一个非常长的链表。相当于每存储一个对象都会发生“hash冲突”，HashMap也退化成了一个“链表”。\n​ ii. 一种简单和常用的算法是(相除取余算法)：\n​ hash值 = hashcode%数组长度\n​ 这种算法可以让hash值均匀的分布在[0,数组长度-1]的区间。 早期的HashTable就是采用这种算法。但是，这种算法由于使用了“除法”，效率低下。JDK后来改进了算法。首先约定数组长度必须为2的整数幂，这样采用位运算即可实现取余的效果：hash值 = hashcode\u0026amp;(数组长度-1)。\n当添加一个元素(key-value)时，首先计算key的hash值，以此确定插入数组中的位置，但是可能存在同一hash值的元素已经被放在数组同一位置了，这时就添加到同一hash值的元素的后面，他们在数组的同一位置，就形成了链表，同一个链表上的Hash值是相同的，所以说数组存放的是链表。 JDK8中，当链表长度大于8时，链表就转换为红黑树，这样又大大提高了查找的效率。\n▪ 取数据过程get(key)\n我们需要通过key对象获得“键值对”对象，进而返回value对象。明白了存储数据过程，取数据就比较简单了，参见以下步骤：\n(1) 获得key的hashcode，通过hash()散列算法得到hash值，进而定位到数组的位置。\n(2) 在链表上挨个比较key对象。 调用equals()方法，将key对象和链表上所有节点的key对象进行比较，直到碰到返回true的节点对象为止。\n(3) 返回equals()为true的节点对象的value对象。\n明白了存取数据的过程，我们再来看一下hashcode()和equals方法的关系：\nJava中规定，两个内容相同(equals()为true)的对象必须具有相等的hashCode。因为如果equals()为true而两个对象的hashcode不同;那在整个存储过程中就发生了悖论。\n▪ 扩容问题\nHashMap的位桶数组，初始大小为16。实际使用时，显然大小是可变的。如果位桶数组中的元素达到(0.75*数组 length)， 就重新调整数组大小变为原来2倍大小。\n扩容很耗时。扩容的本质是定义新的更大的数组，并将旧数组内容挨个拷贝到新数组中。\n▪ JDK8将链表在大于8情况下变为红黑二叉树\nJDK8中，HashMap在存储一个元素时，当对应链表长度大于8时，链表就转换为红黑树，这样又大大提高了查找的效率。\n二叉树和红黑树 二叉树的定义\n二叉树是树形结构的一个重要类型。 许多实际问题抽象出来的数据结构往往是二叉树的形式，即使是一般的树也能简单地转换为二叉树，而且二叉树的存储结构及其算法都较为简单，因此二叉树显得特别重要。\n二叉树(BinaryTree)由一个节点及两棵互不相交的、分别称作这个根的左子树和右子树的二叉树组成。下图中展现了五种不同基本形态的二叉树。\n(a) 为空树。\n(b) 为仅有一个结点的二叉树。\n(c) 是仅有左子树而右子树为空的二叉树。\n(d) 是仅有右子树而左子树为空的二叉树。\n(e) 是左、右子树均非空的二叉树。\n注意事项\n二叉树的左子树和右子树是严格区分并且不能随意颠倒的，图 (c) 与图 (d) 就是两棵不同的二叉树。\n排序二叉树特性如下：\n(1) 左子树上所有节点的值均小于它的根节点的值。\n(2) 右子树上所有节点的值均大于它的根节点的值。\n比如：我们要将数据【14,12,23,4,16,13, 8,,3】存储到排序二叉树中，如下图所示：\n排序二叉树本身实现了排序功能，可以快速检索。但如果插入的节点集本身就是有序的，要么是由小到大排列，要么是由大到小排列，那么最后得到的排序二叉树将变成普通的链表，其检索效率就会很差。 比如上面的数据【14,12,23,4,16,13, 8,,3】，我们先进行排序变成：【3,4,8,12,13,14,16,23】，然后存储到排序二叉树中，显然就变成了链表，如下图所示：\n▪ 平衡二叉树(AVL)\n为了避免出现上述一边倒的存储，科学家提出了“平衡二叉树”。\n在平衡二叉树中任何节点的两个子树的高度最大差别为1，所以它也被称为高度平衡树。 增加和删除节点可能需要通过一次或多次树旋转来重新平衡这个树。\n节点的平衡因子是它的左子树的高度减去它的右子树的高度(有时相反)。带有平衡因子1、0或 -1的节点被认为是平衡的。带有平衡因子 -2或2的节点被认为是不平衡的，并需要重新平衡这个树。\n比如，我们存储排好序的数据【3,4,8,12,13,14,16,23】，增加节点如果出现不平衡，则通过节点的左旋或右旋，重新平衡树结构，最终平衡二叉树如下图所示：\n平衡二叉树追求绝对平衡，实现起来比较麻烦，每次插入新节点需要做的旋转操作次数不能预知。\n▪ 红黑二叉树\n红黑二叉树(简称：红黑树)，它首先是一棵二叉树，同时也是一棵自平衡的排序二叉树。\n红黑树在原有的排序二叉树增加了如下几个要求：\n\\1. 每个节点要么是红色，要么是黑色。\n\\2. 根节点永远是黑色的。\n\\3. 所有的叶节点都是空节点(即 null)，并且是黑色的。\n\\4. 每个红色节点的两个子节点都是黑色。(从每个叶子到根的路径上不会有两个连续的红色节点)\n\\5. 从任一节点到其子树中每个叶子节点的路径都包含相同数量的黑色节点。\n这些约束强化了红黑树的关键性质：从根到叶子的最长的可能路径不多于最短的可能路径的两倍长。这样就让树大致上是平衡的。\n红黑树是一个更高效的检索二叉树，JDK 提供的集合类 TreeMap、TreeSet 本身就是一个红黑树的实现。\nTreeMap的使用和底层实现 TreeMap是红黑二叉树的典型实现。我们打开TreeMap的源码，发现里面有一行核心代码：\n1  private transient Entry\u0026lt;K,V\u0026gt; root = null;   root用来存储整个树的根节点。我们继续跟踪Entry(是TreeMap的内部类)的代码：\n可以看到里面存储了本身数据、左节点、右节点、父节点、以及节点颜色。 TreeMap的put()/remove()方法大量使用了红黑树的理论。本书限于篇幅，不再展开。需要了解更深入的，可以参考专门的数据结构书籍。\nTreeMap和HashMap实现了同样的接口Map，因此，用法对于调用者来说没有区别。HashMap效率高于TreeMap;在需要排序的Map时才选用TreeMap。\nSet接口 Set接口继承自Collection，Set接口中没有新增方法，方法和Collection保持完全一致。我们在前面通过List学习的方法，在Set中仍然适用。因此，学习Set的使用将没有任何难度。\nSet容器特点：无序、不可重复。无序指Set中的元素没有索引，我们只能遍历查找;不可重复指不允许加入重复的元素。更确切地讲，新元素如果和Set中某个元素通过equals()方法对比为true，则不能加入;甚至，Set中也只能放入一个null元素，不能多个。\nSet常用的实现类有：HashSet、TreeSet等，我们一般使用HashSet。\nHashSet基本使用 Set是无序、不可重复\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18  import java.util.HashSet;

s.add(\u0026#34;Jenny\u0026#34;); System.out.println(s);//[Love, I, Jenny] \ts.add(\u0026#34;I\u0026#34;); System.out.println(s);//[Love, I, Jenny]  s.add(null); System.out.println(s);// [null, Love, I, Jenny]  } }   HashSet底层实现 HashSet是采用哈希算法实现，底层实际是用HashMap实现的(HashSet本质就是一个简化版的HashMap)，因此，查询效率和增删效率都比较高。我们来看一下HashSet的源码：\n我们发现里面有个map属性，这就是HashSet的核心秘密。我们再看add()方法，发现增加一个元素说白了就是在map中增加一个键值对，键对象就是这个元素，值对象是名为PRESENT的Object对象。说白了，就是“往set中加入元素，本质就是把这个元素作为key加入到了内部的map中”。\n由于map中key都是不可重复的，因此，Set天然具有“不可重复”的特性。\nTreeSet的使用和底层实现 TreeSet底层实际是用TreeMap实现的，内部维持了一个简化版的TreeMap，通过key来存储Set的元素。 TreeSet内部需要对存储的元素进行排序，因此，我们对应的类需要实现Comparable接口。这样，才能根据compareTo()方法比较对象之间的大小，才能进行内部排序。\nTreeSet和Comparable接口的使用\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34  public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { User u1 = new User(1001, \u0026#34;高淇\u0026#34;, 18);

Integer j = new Integer(50); } }   包装类的用途   作为和基本数据类型对应的类型存在，方便涉及到对象的操作，如Object[]、集合等的操作。\n  包含每种基本数据类型的相关属性如最大值、最小值等，以及相关的操作方法(这些操作方法的作用是在基本数据类型、包装类对象、字符串之间提供相互之间的转化!)。\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  public class Test { /** 测试Integer的用法，其他包装类与Integer类似 */ void testInteger() { // 基本类型转化成Integer对象  Integer int1 = new Integer(10);

test.testInteger(); } }   自动拆箱和自动装箱 自动装箱和拆箱就是将基本数据类型和包装类之间进行自动的互相转换。JDK1.5后，Java引入了自动装箱(autoboxing)/拆箱(unboxing)。\n自动装箱 基本类型的数据处于需要对象的环境中时，会自动转为“对象”。\n我们以Integer为例：在JDK1.5以前，这样的代码 Integer i = 5 是错误的，必须要通过Integer i = new Integer(5) 这样的语句来实现基本数据类型转换成包装类的过程;而在JDK1.5以后，Java提供了自动装箱的功能，因此只需Integer i = 5这样的语句就能实现基本数据类型转换成包装类，这是因为JVM为我们执行了Integer i = Integer.valueOf(5)这样的操作，这就是Java的自动装箱。\n1 2 3  Integer i = 100;//自动装箱 //相当于编译器自动为您作以下的语法编译： Integer i = Integer.valueOf(100);//调用的是valueOf(100)，而不是new Integer(100)   自动拆箱 每当需要一个值时，对象会自动转成基本数据类型，没必要再去显式调用intValue()、doubleValue()等转型方法。\n如 Integer i = 5;int j = i; 这样的过程就是自动拆箱。\n我们可以用一句话总结自动装箱/拆箱：\n自动装箱过程是通过调用包装类的valueOf()方法实现的，而自动拆箱过程是通过调用包装类的 xxxValue()方法实现的(xxx代表对应的基本数据类型，如intValue()、doubleValue()等)。\n1 2 3 4  Integer i = 100; int j = i;//自动拆箱 //相当于编译器自动为您作以下的语法编译： int j = i.intValue();   包装类空指针异常\n1 2 3 4 5 6  public class Test1 { public static void main(String[] args) { Integer i = null; int j = i; } }//空指针异常   1 2 3 4 5 6 7  public class Test1 { public static void main(String[] args) { //示例的代码在编译时期是合法的，但是在运行时期会有错误，因为其相当于：  Integer i = null; int j = i.intValue(); } }   null表示i没有指向任何对象的实体，但作为对象名称是合法的(不管这个对象名称存是否指向了某个对象的实体)。由于实际上i并没有指向任何对象的实体，所以也就不可能操作intValue()方法，这样上面的写法在运行时就会出现NullPointerException错误。\n包装类的缓存处理 整型、char类型所对应的包装类，在自动装箱时，对于-128~127之间的值会进行缓存处理，其目的是提高效率。\n缓存处理的原理为：如果数据在-128~127这个区间，那么在类加载时就已经为该区间的每个数值创建了对象，并将这256个对象存放到一个名为cache的数组中。每当自动装箱过程发生时(或者手动调用valueOf()时)，就会先判断数据是否在该区间，如果在则直接获取数组中对应的包装类对象的引用，如果不在该区间，则会通过new调用包装类的构造方法来创建对象。\n下面我们以Integer类为例\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  public class Test3 { public static void main(String[] args) { Integer in1 = -128; Integer in2 = -128; System.out.println(in1 == in2);//true 因为123在缓存范围内  System.out.println(in1.equals(in2));//true  Integer in3 = 1234; Integer in4 = 1234; System.out.println(in3 == in4);//false 因为1234不在缓存范围内  System.out.println(in3.equals(in4));//true  } }   String类 String类常用的方法有(可翻到第五章5.11.4查看，已讲过，此处不赘述)：\n\\1. String类的下述方法能创建并返回一个新的String对象: concat()、 replace()、substring()、 toLowerCase()、 toUpperCase()、trim()。\n\\2. 提供查找功能的有关方法: endsWith()、 startsWith()、 indexOf()、lastIndexOf()。\n\\3. 提供比较功能的方法: equals()、equalsIgnoreCase()、compareTo()。\n\\4. 其它方法: charAt() 、length()。\nStringBuffer, StringBuilder StringBuffer和StringBuilder非常类似，均代表可变的字符序列。 这两个类都是抽象类AbstractStringBuilder的子类，方法几乎一模一样。\n部分源码 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  // AbstractStringBuilder abstract class AbstractStringBuilder implements Appendable, CharSequence { /** * The value is used for character storage. */ char value[]; //以下代码省略 }   显然，内部也是一个字符数组，但这个字符数组没有用final修饰，随时可以修改。因此，StringBuilder和StringBuffer称之为“可变字符序列”。那两者有什么区别呢?\n  StringBuffer JDK1.0版本提供的类，线程安全，做线程同步检查， 效率较低。\n  StringBuilder JDK1.5版本提供的类，线程不安全，不做线程同步检查，因此效率较高。 建议采用该类。\n  常用方法列表  重载的public StringBuilder append(…)方法  ​ 可以为该StringBuilder 对象添加字符序列，仍然返回自身对象。\n方法 public StringBuilder delete(int start,int end)  ​ 可以删除从start开始到end-1为止的一段字符序列，仍然返回自身对象。\n方法 public StringBuilder deleteCharAt(int index)  ​ 移除此序列指定位置上的 char，仍然返回自身对象。\n重载的public StringBuilder insert(…)方法  ​ 可以为该StringBuilder 对象在指定位置插入字符序列，仍然返回自身对象。\n方法 public StringBuilder reverse()  ​ 用于将字符序列逆序，仍然返回自身对象。\n 方法 public String toString() 返回此序列中数据的字符串表示形式。\n  和 String 类含义类似的方法：\n  1 2 3 4 5 6  public int indexOf(String str) public int indexOf(String str,int fromIndex) public String substring(int start) public String substring(int start,int end) public int length() char charAt(int index)   基本用法 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  public class TestStringBufferAndBuilder 1{ public static void main(String[] args) { /**StringBuilder*/ StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 7; i++) { sb.append((char) (\u0026#39;a\u0026#39; + i));//追加单个字符  } System.out.println(sb.toString());//转换成String输出  sb.append(\u0026#34;, I can sing my abc!\u0026#34;);//追加字符串  System.out.println(sb.toString()); /**StringBuffer*/ StringBuffer sb2 = new StringBuffer(\u0026#34;中华人民共和国\u0026#34;); sb2.insert(0, \u0026#34;爱\u0026#34;).insert(0, \u0026#34;我\u0026#34;);//插入字符串  System.out.println(sb2); sb2.delete(0, 2);//删除子字符串  System.out.println(sb2); sb2.deleteCharAt(0).deleteCharAt(0);//删除某个字符  System.out.println(sb2.charAt(0));//获取某个字符  System.out.println(sb2.reverse());//字符串逆序  } }   可变字符串和不可变字符串使用陷阱 String一经初始化后，就不会再改变其内容了。对String字符串的操作实际上是对其副本(原始拷贝)的操作，原来的字符串一点都没有改变。比如：\nString s =\u0026quot;a\u0026rdquo;; 创建了一个字符串\ns = s+\u0026quot;b\u0026rdquo;; 实际上原来的\u0026quot;a\u0026quot;字符串对象已经丢弃了，现在又产生了另一个字符串s+\u0026quot;b\u0026rdquo;(也就是\u0026quot;ab\u0026rdquo;)。 如果多次执行这些改变串内容的操作，会导致大量副本字符串对象存留在内存中，降低效率。如果这样的操作放到循环中，会极大影响程序的时间和空间性能，甚至会造成服务器的崩溃。\n相反，StringBuilder和StringBuffer类是对原字符串本身操作的，可以对字符串进行修改而不产生副本拷贝或者产生少量的副本。因此可以在循环中使用。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28  //效率测试 public class Test { public static void main(String[] args) { /**使用String进行字符串的拼接*/ String str8 = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; //本质上使用StringBuilder拼接, 但是每次循环都会生成一个StringBuilder对象  long num1 = Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory();//获取系统剩余内存空间  long time1 = System.currentTimeMillis();//获取系统的当前时间  for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 5000; i++) { str8 = str8 + i;//相当于产生了10000个对象  } long num2 = Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory(); long time2 = System.currentTimeMillis(); System.out.println(\u0026#34;String占用内存 : \u0026#34; + (num1 - num2)); System.out.println(\u0026#34;String占用时间 : \u0026#34; + (time2 - time1)); /**使用StringBuilder进行字符串的拼接*/ StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;); long num3 = Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory(); long time3 = System.currentTimeMillis(); for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; 5000; i++) { sb1.append(i); } long num4 = Runtime.getRuntime().freeMemory(); long time4 = System.currentTimeMillis(); System.out.println(\u0026#34;StringBuilder占用内存 : \u0026#34; + (num3 - num4)); System.out.println(\u0026#34;StringBuilder占用时间 : \u0026#34; + (time4 - time3)); } }     String：不可变字符序列。\n  StringBuffer：可变字符序列，并且线程安全，但是效率低。\n  StringBuilder：可变字符序列，线程不安全，但是效率高(一般用它)。\n  时间处理相关类 在计算机世界，我们把1970 年 1 月 1 日 00:00:00定为基准时间，每个度量单位是毫秒(1秒的千分之一)\n我们用long类型的变量来表示时间，从基准时间往前几亿年，往后几亿年都能表示。如果想获得现在时刻的“时刻数值”，可以使用：\n1  long now = System.currentTimeMillis();   这个“时刻数值”是所有时间类的核心值，年月日都是根据这个“数值”计算出来的。我们工作学习涉及的时间相关类有如下这些： 时间类 \\1. Date() 分配一个Date对象，并初始化此对象为系统当前的日期和时间，可以精确到毫秒)。\n\\2. Date(long date) 分配 Date 对象并初始化此对象，以表示自从标准基准时间(称为“历元(epoch)”，即 1970 年 1 月 1 日 00:00:00 GMT)以来的指定毫秒数。\n\\3. boolean after(Date when) 测试此日期是否在指定日期之后。\n\\4. booleanbefore(Date when) 测试此日期是否在指定日期之前。\n\\5. boolean equals(Object obj) 比较两个日期的相等性。\n\\6. long getTime() 返回自 1970 年 1 月 1 日 00:00:00 GMT 以来此 Date 对象表示的毫秒数。\n\\7. String toString() 把此 Date 对象转换为以下形式的 String：\n​ dow mon dd hh:mm:ss zzz yyyy 其中： dow 是一周中的某一天 (Sun、 Mon、Tue、Wed、 Thu、 Fri、 Sat)。\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17  import java.util.Date; public class TestDate { public static void main(String[] args) { Date date1 = new Date();
